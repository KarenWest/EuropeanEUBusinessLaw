Xavier, earlier we talked about eh,
the purpose of our MOOC.
Maybe, we should say a few words about
the structure of the MOOC, as well.
It's a MOOC that is divided
into three segments.
Where we distribute the different courses.
>> Yes.
>> Do you recall the build-up?
>> I can recall the build-up.
>> Yeah.
>> And, as you say,
it's divided into three segments.
And, the first segment of
the course focuses on fundamental
principles free movement, or economic
freedoms, and intellectual property law.
>> Hm.
Hm.
>> The second segment looks
at competition law state aid,
public procurement and tax law.
>> Hm.
>> And then, finally, the, the third
part of the course is
based on label law procedural law and
environmental law.
>> And, between the different segments,
we have quizzes.
The students can during all the classes,
answer questions, but
at the end of a segment,
they really have to show that they have
learned by responding to the quizzes.
>> Absolutely.
>> Which are eh, graded automatically.
>> Automatically graded as the quizzes.
>> Yes.
>> Then we have a, also, an assignment.
>> Yes.
What, what is the assignment?
>> Oh, the assessment is based on the, on
the case law and that is just the case law
studies of 3,000 words which in contrast
to the quizzes, are peer-reviewed.
>> Mm.
So here, the student would have to first,
write a kind of approach to his or
her presentation.
Purpose, method, the limitations,
those kind of things.
And, explain what is the problem
that the student will address.
>> Yes.
>> And, that will be peer reviewed and
discussed.
Is, is this the right approach?
And then,
once we're through with that peer review,
then the student will have to write
the thesis, 3,000 words you said,
that will be then reviewed
by other students as well.
>> Exactly.
>> So, that's the way [CROSSTALK].
>> Then, you summarize perfectly
how the system is working.
>> This writing a thesis is optional,
it's not a requirement.
It's for the student who would
like to have a distinction.
>> Yes.
>> But, we, as a research organization,
we are, of course,
interested in seeing to
it that the students,.
>> Of course.
>> Try to obtain, distinction.
>> Of course.
