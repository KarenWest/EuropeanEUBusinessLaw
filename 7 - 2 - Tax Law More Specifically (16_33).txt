Welcome.
As explained in the previous tutorial,
direct and
indirect taxes have to fulfill
a number of requirements.
That are set forth by the treaty of
functioning of the European Union.
And that is what we're going to
look at in this lecture.
To start with, we can take a look
at Article 30 of the TFEU treaty.
Which forbids import and
export duties between member states or
any charges having an equivalent
effect to a customs duty.
Article 34 also prohibits quantitive
restrictions on imports and
all measures having equivalent effect.
The prohibition of import and
export duties would be meaningless.
If it was not a accompanied
by an obligation on
member states to treat
imported products from the EU.
In the same way as they treat
products produced domestically.
Therefore, Article 110
of the TFEU prohibits
discriminatory and
protective product taxation.
This article only allows
product taxation as part of
a general domestic consumption tax.
Levied indiscriminately
on those domestic and
foreign products, that is,
turn over taxes and excise duties.
Current taxation is particularly
challenged under this prohibition.
As most member states of the EU with
a strong vehicle manufacturing sector
tend to favor their national production.
A series of cases at the Court
of Justice of the EU
offer an example of the application
of Article 110 of the TFEU.
For instance,
in the case 112/84 the French road tax
was held to be in breach
of Article 110 of the TFEU.
As the rate of tax payable was determined
by the power rating of the car.
And it applied at a much higher
rate to extremely powerful cars,
over 16 horsepower.
Which car manufacturers in France did not
produce, but which were manufactured and
imported from Germany.
Although, in the application of
this tax no formal distinction was
made based on the origin of the car.
It manifestly showed protective features
as it applied only to imported cars.
Because of this, consumers were
discouraged from buying non-French cars
and Article 110 of the TFEU
was found to apply.
In some cases where there has
been no domestic production to
protect such as the Denmark.
The court has found in Article 34,
prohibiting quantitative restitution
to imports to apply instead.
As a very high tax on imported new
cars may still have the effect of
restricting importation of new cars.
Even if not discriminatory or protective.
Another landmark case in the field of
Value Added Tax showing how article
110 of the TFEU applies is
the Gaston Schul case 15/81.
Dealing with the intra-EU
importation of a second hand yacht
from France by an end consumer which
triggered Dutch VAT on the import.
Had the boat been purchased from a Dutch
seller no VAT would have been charged.
The court held this levy of VAT to be
in breach of Article 110 of the TFEU.
As the accumulating of VAT for
imported favored domestic transactions.
However member states with a national
policy that pressures an objective and
legitimate aim that is non-discriminatory
and non protectionist.
Such as health protection like
alcohol taxation may adopt this
taxes under certain risk rates.
Beside this prohibition of
discriminatory products Article 113
of the TFEU specifically provides for
the council acting unanimously.
In accordance with a special
legislative procedure.
And after consulting the European
parliament and the economic and
social committee to adopt provisions for
the harmonization of member states rules.
In their area of indirect taxation in
principally in VAT and excised duties.
A large number of directives and
regulations, that is secondary
legislation have already been agreed in
this area on the basis of that article.
The commission's legislative strategy
particularly in respect of the VAT
as well as environmental and urgent
taxation has been clearly established.
There is another, also another reason
why indirect taxes in especially VAT and
custom duty are harmonized but
not direct taxes.
Which has to do with the financing
of the European's own resources.
The EU's traditional resources
consist of custom duties on
imports from outside the EU and
sugar levies.
EU governments keep 25% to
cover the cost of collection.
The European Union also collects
a earned resource a standard
percentage which is levied on
the harmonized VAT basis of each country.
The VAT resource account for
around 4 billion Euros.
The VAT base is to be taxed.
It's capped at 50% of grace
national income for each country.
This rule is intended to prevent
less prepared countries having to
pay a disproportionate amount
in such countries consumption.
And so, VAT tends to account for
higher percentage of national income.
Finally a standard percentage is
levied on the gross national income of
each EU country which has nothing
to do with member states taxes.
And which is actually
the largest source of revenue.
It's 99 billion euros for 2010.
It is therefore essential that the basis
of VAT is the same in all member states of
the European Union and
therefore the VAT bases are harmonized.
Principally in the six VAT
directive of 1977 that
was recast on first January
2007 by number 2006/112/EC.
VAT is charged as a percentage of
the price of goods and services.
Which means that the actual tax
burden is visible at each stage in
the production and distribu,
distribution chain.
The tax is collected fractionally.
That is via a system of partial payments.
Whereby the taxable person of
VAT registered business can
deduct from the VAT they have collected.
The amount of the tax they have paid
to other taxable personal purchases for
their business activities.
This mechanism ensures that
the tax is neutral regardless of
how many transactions are involved.
The tax is paid to the revenue
by the supplier of the goods or
services who is the taxable person.
But it is actually the,
paid by the purchaser to
the supplier as part of the price.
It is therefore an indirect tax.
As regard direct taxes
the only primary source of law
that had any impact with
Article 293 of the EC Treaty.
And it was enforced prior
to first of December 2009.
This was the basis on which
member states adopted
the arbitration convention dealing
with tax audits and transfer pricing.
It provided that member
states should in so
far as necessary enter into
negotiations with each other.
With the view to securing for
the benefit of their nationals.
The abolition of double
taxation within the community.
This article was repealed and
nobody knows why.
But whether or
not secondary EU legislation's such
as directives and regulations exist.
Member states' tax systems and
tax treaties must in any event respect
the fundamental EU treaty principles.
On the free movement of workers, services,
capital and the freedom of establishment.
That are dealt with by Articles 45, 49,
56, 63 of the TFEU, and
the principle of non-discrimination.
Moreover, in more general terms,
Article 21 of the treaty.
Provides that every citizen of
the union has the right to move and
reside freely within
the territory of member states.
The agreement on the European Economic
Area extends to individual and
enterprises of EEA states.
Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway.
It applied to principles of free
movement of goods, person, services, and
capital, as well as article conditions
of competition and non-discrimination.
However, secondary legislation does
not apply in these EEA states.
In the light of these rules,
from 1986 onwards,
the court of justice EU has consistently
ruled in more than 350 cases.
That although direct taxation
falls within the competence of
individual member states.
Member states must exercise that
competence in conformity with EU law.
The courthouse for instance found that
taxpayers who move their residence to
another member state are exercising
their freedom of establishment.
Under Article 43 and 49 of the treaty.
With the consequence that
the state of departure may not
impose exit taxes on them.
As this may discourage them from moving.
A lot of cases have also condemned
member states' tax legislation.
Which taxes the proceeds from capital,
investments, from abroad such
as dividends, interest or
capital gains on the sale of assets.
These may not be taxed heavier
than domestic inven investments.
So basically,
a member state may not discourage cross
border transactions through
a penalizing tax system.
Equally member states may not attract
foreign direct investment from
other states through
domestic tax legislation.
Which may be held in breach of EU
competition of rules on state aid.
Indeed, the ECJ has ruled in
several cases that Article
107 of the treaty forbids
states to adopt tax reliefs.
That may in effect benefit
a specific category of taxpayers.
Such as non-residents.
Gibraltar.
It had very attractive tax regime for
non-residents, but it had to repeal.
The same is also true for
state aid to national economic actors.
And may times the court has stated that
a member state may not reserve tax breaks.
Are advantages that benefit a sectorial or
geographical business sector.
Yet another limit on member
states powers lie in,
in the need to combat aggressive
tax planning strategies.
And the court has always been
deliberately strong in the face of
arguments from member states.
Most states try to
protect their tax bases.
And use anti abuse provisions
to counter schemes involving
the use of artificial transactions
in order to reduce tax liability.
For instance, most states reduce the
benefits of favorable inbound dividend.
When the distributing subsidiary is
located in a low tax jurisdiction.
The court of justice has consistently
stated that such anti abuse provisions
are incompatible with freedom of
establishment or freedom of capital.
If they strike blindly at all
transactions, presuming that
a lower tax in another member state
automatically amounts to tax avoidance.
Only tax provisions that catch wholly
artificial arraignments designed
to escape the national
tax normally applicable.
Or compatible with
the fundamental freedoms.
The rule of the European
court of justice to
interpret the TFEU has had a considerable
impact on member states tax legislation.
Over 350 cases deal with the free movement
provisions with help of principles of law.
Such as, the equality principle.
That is the rule underlying
equal treatment of
taxpayers in comparable situations.
The legality principle.
There is no taxation
without representation.
And last, but not least,
the proportionality principle.
Which allows derogation to
the aforementioned principles only to
the extent or in balance with the overall
goal of the tax legislation in question.
Especially where the line of
delimitation between tax planning and
tax abuse is difficult to draw.
To conclude and
sum up this tutorial session I
just want to come back to
the statement made at the beginning.
Where I highlighted the difficult
mission facing member states.
They are trying to finance their
domestic welfare with the help of taxes.
Other which they have exclusive
competence while at the same time,
seeking to respect their
EU law obligations.
Which force them to give up some tax basis
to the benefit of all the member states.
When taxpayers engage in
cross border transactions.
This results in a huge number of
conflicts between taxpayers and
the National Tax Administrations.
And there is more than enough
material in relation to
these interesting issues in this
area to merit further study.
This is why we offer a one year
masters degree in European and
International Taxation.
At the Department of Business Law
at school of Economic and
Management in co-operation
with the Law faculty.
Thank you for your attention.
