Welcome back.
In this lecture, we're going to
look at European Union case law.
I will show you how to search for the
cases, explain the numbers of the cases,
and how to search within the document.
Let's look at a case that you
will read in one of the courses,
C-341/05, a libel case.
Let me start by explaining
the case number.
The letter tells us it's a case
from the Court of Justice,
the number 341 is the serial number,
and finally, we have the year.
The number is given when
it comes to the court so
the year is when the case started.
If you find a T or
an F in front of the number,
it is a case from either the General
court or the Civil Service Tribunal.
Quite recently, a new system to cite and
to number the cases has been introduced.
ECLI is the new
European Case Law Identifier.
The ECLI number is a number that will
include both European and National courts
and it is supposed to improve
search facilities for case law.
The Laval case has the following
number: ECLI, EU:C:2007:809.
First comes the country code,
then code of the court that rendered the
judgement, the year of the decision, and
finally the sequential number.
This sequential number is in a format
that is decided upon each member state.
It could consist of up to
25 alphanumeric characters.
So let's search for the case.
I suggest you use the database
that you find on the website for
the Court of Justice
of the European Union.
I enter the case number
in the first field.
You can see written beside the field
in what way you should write.
You will receive the matches
in a list of results by case.
You could also sort the matches
by documents if you prefer.
First of all you can see that it
is a judgment of the court sitting
at the Grand Chamber,
the 18th of December 2007.
Below, you'll find the parties.
Then comes a short description
of the case with keywords and
relevant directives and articles.
The judgments and opinions used to be
published in the Reports of Cases.
You can see that this
case was published in
Reports of Cases in 2007,
part one, page 11,767.
Since 2012,
the printed version of Reports of
Cases has been replaced
by an electronic version.
It has been the tradition to refer
to the reports of cases, and
I'm sure you will meet many
references from the reports.
But today the recommendation is another.
And the new way to refer to a case is to a
combination of the usual name of the case,
the number in the register case number,
ECLI number and the paragraph.
You will of course find
the judgments here.
And you will also find the opinion
from the advocate general.
This is a document where you can find a
legal analysis of the case which has been
presented to the court independently by
the advocate general before the judgment.
Many times you can find much more
information in the opinion than in
the judgment.
This could be useful information if the
court decides to follow the imp, opinion.
If you would like,
you can access more information
by clicking on the small symbol.
A lot of information is collected here.
Further down you can find citations
of case law or legislation,
dates of importance, references
like notes on academic writings.
As this case has been discussed a lot,
there are a lot of references to the case.
Finally, you find procedural
analysis information,
like the names of the judges, etc.
As you can see, there is a lot of
information about a judgement.
Many times,
you only want to get access to the case.
So let's end up with looking at how you
find the different parts in the case.
Depending on where you take the case,
the document will look differently.
In the report of cases,
which is the official version,
it starts with the presentation of the
case, parties, dates and peoples involved.
Then, comes the grounds,
consisting of the judgment, legal context,
the dispute in the main proceedings and
questions referred.
In the end, you'll find the cost but
also the operative part.
The sections in the grounds are numbered,
referred to as paragraphs.
The operative parts are also numbered
starting again on number one.
In EUR-Lex, you will find
an added summary of judgement in
the beginning of the document.
I suggest you go and search yourselves
right now for the Laval case right now.
Start in the database Curia website for
the Court of Jus,
Justice of the European Union.
You'll find the database in the link list.
Thanks for listening and see you later.
