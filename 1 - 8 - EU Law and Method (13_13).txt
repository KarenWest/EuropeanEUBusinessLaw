During this lecture,
I will explain why the legal methods of
the European Court of Justice differ from
the legal methods applied in
the Member States in various ways.
I will structure the presentation in
the following order, I will show first
that EU law is based on different sources
of law than European national law.
Second, that EU law is
based on case law to
a larger extent than
European national law.
Third, that EU law has a different
approach to general principles of law, and
fourth, that EU law has different
methods of interpretation.
Finally, I will short, shortly explain
how you find sources of EU law.
Union law can be divided into primary law,
general principles of law,
binding and non-binding secondary law,
agreements between the Union and third
countries or international organizations,
case law from the Court of Justice and
the General Court, travaux pr√àparatoires,
or preparatory work, opinions of
advocate-generals, and doctrine.
To understand Union law you must
understand the significant difference
between primary law and secondary law.
The European Union is based upon treaties,
which has a special significance
under international law.
Primary law is composed of these treaties.
The most important treaties today is
the Treaty on the European Union,
TEU, and the Treaty on the Functioning
of the European Union, TFEU.
They are included in the reading
material to this lecture.
The treaties form the basis,
not only of the institutions, but
also of the powers that can be
exercised by those institutions, and
the procedure under which
they must operate, therefore,
the basis of any legal action must be
founded on a treaty provision, and
the treaties also give the Court of
Justice the important task to rule on
interpretation of EU law and
on the validity of EU secondary law.
Consequently, primary law is the basis for
the EU legal system,
created by the Member States and
secondary law is the sources of law
that the EU system produced by itself.
This means that secondary law is only
valid if it complies with primary law and
should always be interpreted in
conformity with primary law.
This explains why the provisions in
the treaty such as the four freedoms,
are of general importance in
application of the EU law.
Moreover, the chapter of fundamental
rights is also part of primary law.
This means that the provisions
in the charter are of
general importance when EU law is applied.
The charter can partly be
described as a codification of
general principles of EU law.
It is built largely upon the European
Convention on Human Rights but
includes also additional economic and
social rights.
Previous case law from the Court of
Justice corresponding to the principles
included in the charter is relevant for
the application of the charter.
Advantage of this generally
legal principles mentioned or
not in the charter, are the same for
the union legal system as for member states.
They help to fill gaps,
which always arise when it is
not possible to have a written text
to cover every legal situation,
however, the gaps in EU
law has been bigger and
more frequent than usually
is the case in national law.
This has increased the need for
general principles of law.
Before the charter became binding in 2010,
these general principles constituted
the unwritten law of the union.
Now they are instead to a large extent,
codified.
Secondary sources of law,
which are binding,
always studying article 258 in
the Treaty on the Functioning of
the European Union, as regulations,
directives, and decisions.
Although recommendations and
opinions are mentioned in
the same article this on of legal binding,
there are other
non-binding legal acts not mentioned
in the treaty such as communications,
resolutions, and
guidelines as will be explained later such
non binding acts of an important
function in the union legal order.
As pointed out before, secondary law
is produced by the union institutions.
That is to say the union as a legislature,
therefore,
in order to adopt EU legislation.
There must be proper legal
basis in the treaties.
The construction is similar for
international agreements.
The European Union has power to
conclude such agreements but
only if the basic treaties allow it.
If the treaties are not
providing a sufficient basis
to conclude an international agreement,
the Member States can 
support the union and conclude
the agreement together with the union.
Such agreements, where both the union and
the Member States are parties,
are called mixed agreements.
Another source, which is of
fundamental importance in the EU
legal system is the case law,
of the Court of Justice, and
especially in some areas,
the case law of the general court.
In many Member States, case law is of
course an important source of law but
in the EU system, this source has
a particular significance because in
certain areas,
there are no written law at all.
In such areas,
the meaning of EU law is to be
found almost exclusively in
the case law from the courts.
This explains the need for a specific
type on non-binding legislation,
usually adopted by the commission.
This act summarized, to a large extent,
case law from the courts and
important decisions from
the commission. These communications or
guidelines are not binding, but
they refer to important judgments and
decisions, that,
therefore represent the present state of
Union law in different areas, and
our continuing area revised and updated.
The case law from the union courts can
also be understood by the opinions from
the advocate-generals, which assist
the Court of Justice in many cases.
These opinions are not binding, but
of course can be an important legal
source if they are followed by the court.
Other sources, earlier mentioned,
is travaux preparatoires, or
preparatory work.
This term refers to working documents in
the legislative process like inquiries,
reports, proposals and drafts.
They can demonstrate the intention
behind the EU legislation or
the will of the EU legislature.
In some member states,
especially the Scandinavian ones,
these documents are very
important sources of law, however,
in the union law, they have
traditionally less significance, but
they are more often referred
to nowadays than in the past.
Finally, even if the doctrine,
that is to say,
the academic literature, is not
referred to by the Court of Justice and
of course not binding,
the large number of books and
articles analyzing EU law is still
a useful source when applying the law.
The doctrine is used by
the courts even if this is
not specifically mentioned
in the judgements.
So far, we have talked about sources of
union law, but we should never forget that
the EU legal system is not complete in
the same way as a national legal system.
It is designed to foster
a European integration and
not to become a new legal system replacing
the legal systems of the Member States.
When the Court of Justice has developed
Union law, it has therefore found
guidance, not only international treaties,
but also in national law.
The Court has developed
a comparative method which aims to
ascertain that the legal principles
used in EU law can be regarded as
recognized by at least a great
majority of the Member States.
In using these comparative method,
the court has been very careful to develop
principles that are in accord with
legal values in the Member States.
The basic idea is that the principles
derived in this way must correspond to
the common constitutional
traditions of the Member States.
This dynamic development has
also influenced the court's
interpretation methods.
The Court of Justice has a reputation for
exploiting its teleological method 
of interpretation, in order to
develop EU law rather freely,
but if one looked closer on
the methods actually used,
it is clear that many different
methods are in operation,
such as analogic, contextual,
and literal interpretation.
As Union Law is composed of 24 different
but legally equal language versions,
the court sometimes has to scrutinize and
compare these different versions.
One of the methods of importance is the
autonomous interpretation of concepts and
terms in Union law.
Legal concept in Union law should not
be confused with similar concepts in
national law.
The reason for this is to avoid
diverging interpretations of
union concepts in the Member States.
In order to ascertain the well functioning on the Union legal order
it is of utmost importance that Union law
is applied equally in all Member States.
This is also the reason why national
courts may and sometimes must refer
questions with interpretation of EU
law to the Court of Justice, and
are not permitted to declare
the Union act invalid, but
must always refer such a delicate
question to the Court of Justice.
It is of greatest importance for
correct application of EU law that
lawyers in the Member States accept that
Union law to a large extent consists,
of case law and
legal principles, and
learn to manage the problems of
interpretation and application that arise.
Such problems cannot be
solved in accordance with
traditional national legal methods,
but rather with EU law method,
that is to say with the legal methods
delop, developed by the Court of Justice.
Finally, something should be said
about the ways to find EU law.
Nowadays, sources of Union law is
rather easy to find on the internet.
The general database for EU law is EURlex,
and when it comes to case law,
the Court of Justice has its own web page,
which is very useful.
It is called Curia,
which is Latin for court.
One more practical issue concerns
the numbering of articles.
Through the Lisbon Treaty, the numbering
of the treaty articles was changed.
This also happened through
the Amsterdam Treaty.
This can be confusing when you read
the case law as the Court of Justice,
of course, refers to the number that
existed at the time of the case.
I'll give you some examples of changed
numbers so you can understand what I mean.
Tables of equivalence can be found in
some textbooks, and also in the five
EU treaties which you'll find in
the reading material to this lecture.
That's all for now,
thank you for your attention and
good luck with the rest of this course.
