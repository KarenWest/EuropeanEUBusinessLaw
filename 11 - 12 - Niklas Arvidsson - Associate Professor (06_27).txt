about your activity in the MOOT court.
MOOC, I should say.
Would you please introduce yourself?
>> Yeah.
Um,as you said,
my name is Nika Savelson and
I'm a teacher and
researcher here at the faculty,
although my,
my primary interest lies within
the fields of law and capital markets.
And then,then I am also interested in
contract law, commercial law in general.
>> Commercial law in general?
>> Yeah.

when did you present that?

So that's?
>> Four.
>> Four years ago.
>> Yes.
Yeah, that's right.
>> And since then you've become
an associate professor, so
there has been more.
But what, what was your,
dissertation about?
>> In my dissertation I,
I investigated shareholder's agreements.
And try, try to, to see what kind of legal
effects they have on the company relations
and also contractually and, and then to
investigate into frequency and so on.
>> Did you make any surprising findings?
In your,.
>> I think I did, yes.
Recording how, how they are supposed to,
to be handled in court.
it's, it's a quite a lot of confusion
about they're legal affects.
I try to, to, to clarify the questions and
also to, yeah.
>> Unfortunately you wrote it in Swedish.
>> Yeah, yeah.
>> So it's not available to
the international public.
>> No, that's right, it's.
>> Have,
have you been writing since that station?
>> Yeah, absolutely.
>> But mainly in Swedish again, perhaps?
>> Yep.
Yes, mainly Swedish, yes.
>> Okay [LAUGH].
>> That's right,.
>> Maybe we can pressure you to also think
on the international
dimension in the future.
>> I, I'm aware of the pressures.
[LAUGH] Yes, absolutely.
>> Very good, very good.
But you are primarily a teacher a and
active at the faculty.
What kind of courses
are you teaching here?
>> Am teaching company law and also I am
teaching in within the law of
obligations and then there yeah, so.
And also some,some,
some teaching within contract law.
>> How would you describe
yourself as a teacher?
>> I would describe
myself as a person who is
very interested and
has an committed to, to the teaching,.
>> Traditional teaching or
problem-based teaching?
>> Both.
Both, I guess, yeah.
And I like to be a bit spontaneous in,
in, in my teaching.
And I, I I will also like to provoke
my students sometimes you know and
try to get them to think themselves that's
something that I find very important.
>> Is anything of this coming through
in your MOOC presentation here?
>> I hope it is.
>> Yeah.
>> Yes.
>> What, what is your section about?
>> My section will be about the company
low dimension within Europe and
also a little about capital,
the free movement of capital and
how it's connected to the company.
So we'll be discussing both
the European dimension in terms of the.
Directives and regulations there are,
and and also will
stress the importance of a national,
national jurisdiction in order to,
to asses the European company or
dimension.
>> Would you say that these are important
areas in the European land?
>> Absolutely.
Yes
>> Impact on day-to-day life for industry.
>> Absolutely.
Since, since that a lot of them,
the big companies especially,
have a lot of capital and of course
they are of huge societal influence.
>> mm
>> Yeah.
>> When, what should the students
expect as a learning outcome
after having studied your section?
>> My hopes are that they will have
a basic understanding of the European
framework, of, of,
of regulation regarding company role and
I also hope to give them
some insights into,
into comparative questions from
the jurisdictions of the European union.
>> Is it okay to start studying your
section, or do I have to prepare?
>> Yes I, I, it's try to, to,
to to to make it as easy as possible.
>> You'd rather inspire to further reading
than requiring that they are prepared.
>> Yes.
>> To what extent is your area affected by
the present Euro crisis.
>> It is affected of course,
we have had for quite a few years,
a daily date about corporate cabinets for
example and
how to,to balance the different
types of interest and
stakes there are regarding
corporate activity and
yes off course it is effective but
it's hard to say whether what,
what kind of outcome will follow from,
from this discussions and endeavours.
>> Thank you very much.
>> Thank you.
