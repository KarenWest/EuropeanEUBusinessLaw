Hello Cecile Brokelind.
What a pleasure to sit here in the Library
of the Law Faculty together with you.
You are an ordinary professor
of law at the Lund University.
Could you tell us a little bit more about
yourself and your academic background?
>> Thanks for welcoming me today.
yes, with pleasure.
I'm a living example of
European integration.
Actually, I'm French from Orichins and
I lived there 28 years
before moving to Sweden.
And it was 1992 before Sweden actually
joined the European Union, and
I was recruited at the Law Faculty to give
a couple of lectures in competition law.
And pretty soon after that,
I was recruited as a doctoral student.
And since then, I haven't changed job,
I'm still at the Law Faculty,
and at the Department of Business Law
at the School of Economics,
where eh,
I'm actually teaching in this field.
>> In, in what field?
>> Oh,
in the field of European Union tax law.
>> Tax law.
>> Right.
But you are a researcher is that right?
>> That's right.
>> What was your dissertation?
When did you produce it?
>> It's quite easy to remember,
it's year 2000, actually.
>> Okay.
>> A date not to forget.
>> Mm-hm.
>> It was about group taxation in
the European Union.
And how member states of
the European Union actually were
introducing in their laws
a directive that was enacted in
1992 in the field of direct taxation,
was quite unique.
So my thesis was about
an interpretation of this directive.
Tax from the beginning.
>> Right.
>> And your continued research,
has it also been only tax?
>> Absolutely.
I've not diverted from my target
which is to be a international and
European tax law expert.
There have been many projects.
One of them involved tax incentives,
research and
development, and technology
transfers within the European Union.
Some other ones introduced
the concept of human rights
into direct taxation, and
quite recently we had a case in Sweden,
very interesting one dealing with
a charter on European fundamental rights,
in a case involving direct taxation,
where I was involved into.
>> Okay.
And what are you doing presently in
terms of research?
>> Right now I'm lifting a little
bit up the level of research to
find out whether constitutional paralyism
has an impact in international taxation,
especially in the field of state aid.
That's one of my research projects.
The other one is about the tax
expenditures declaration,
how the follow up of member states should
look like when they spend tax money.
>> So
it's easy to assume that your course,
your contribution to
the course is all about tax.
>> That's right.
>> Can you explain a little
bit what's you're presenting?
>> Sure.
In this short, very short presentation
about European Union tax law.
I will explain that members states of
European Union have a duty to follow some
rules that the European Union has enacted
through the fundamental treaties and
with the fundamental freedoms and
they're not completely free as it can
look like from the outside to do whatever
they want in the field of tax policies.
>> Do the students have to prepare
themself in a specific way for
studying your course or
is it just to embark on the course?
>> I don't think it's actually
necessary because I've included in
these chapters some further
reading assignments.
If they feel they need some support at
the moment when they study the course.
They can go away from the film and
dig into the literature.
>> Once they're through with the,
this section,
what do you hope that they have
achieved in terms of learning outcome?
>> That's actually a very good question,
because it's a quite short chapter, and
I don't expect them to be completely
aware of all the case law of the Court of
Justice of the European Union in the field
of both direct and indirect taxation.
But what I expect from them is
that they have a feeling for
where to fetch further information when
they're going to determine whether
the European Union actually sets limits
to member states tax sovereignty.
>> But they will have acquired
a basic understanding of direct and
indirect taxation?
[CROSSTALK].
>> That's right.
>> And how European law is
influencing national law?
[CROSSTALK].
>> That's right.
That's the target.
That's exactly the target.
>> Yes, okay.
>> The balance of powers between
member states of the European Union in
that field.
>> Is tax cau, creating a problem?
I mean when you,
think about the European Union and
it's present I don't know if to
call it a crisis, but problems.
Is tax law affected by the problems
we're seeing presently in Europe?
>> This is a very actual question,
actually.
And it's quite central to
the solving of the problems that
member states and all the states
right now know about the crisis.
The the OECD which is an international
organization quite bigger
than the European Union that is very much
involved into big projects have actually
identified a way to make member
states cooperate with each other.
The European Union has been since
1957 one of these four has.
And the European Union
is now led by the OECD
in the field of international taxation.
As you might be aware,
there are a lot of multinational
enterprises that make lots of money.
Which actually nobody can get a grasp on,
and that's been a major problem to solve
the question, where to fetch more money,
and filling the state's cash?
Actually, the OECD this Organization for
Economic Development
has come with a project called
BEPS: Base Erosion Profit Shifting
that will prevent multi-nationals
from deciding where to be taxed.
And in such way, let states take their
taxes where they should be taken
in other words we've now reached,
thanks to the crisis, a stage
of coordination and political dialog
between members which is quite unique.
You could say that the European Union
started this process but
today it's been enhanced thanks
to the dialog with OECD.
>> This actually makes very good
introduction to your first class.
>> That's right.
>> So let's start on it.
>> Welcome.
>> Thank you.
