Hello, welcome to the short introduction,
into the first of the competition law
rules to be considered in this course.
This session considers
in a very general way,
the application of 101 of the Treaty of
the Functioning of the European Union.
And our objective in this session is to
introduce in an overview way the main
components of article 101(1) of the Treaty
of the Functioning of the European Union.
Of course, the article prohibits
agreements, decisions by associations of
undertakings, and concerted practices
that are restrictive of competition.
But in order to establish one
Article 101(1) has been breached,
we need to really consider
four essential questions.
The first of these is whether
there are undertakings or
associations of undertakings, involved in
the potentially anti-competitive behavior.
The second is whether or not is there
an agreement or concerted practice.
Or in fact a decision of by associations
that is under consideration.
And thirdly, we need to really look
to see whether or not there has
been an effect on trade or a potential
effect on trade, between member states.
And lastly, the consideration is whether
or not this behavior, either by its object
or by its effect, prevents or distorts
competition within the internal market.
So, turning to the first point for
us to consider today is whether or
not we can define
the concept of undertaking.
Of course, it's a critically important
term, since only agreements and concerted
practices between undertakings fall
under the provisions of article 101(1).
However, the treaty itself does not
give us a definition of undertaking.
And we really need to look at the case
law from the European Union courts,
to clarify what exactly we mean
by this concept, undertaking.
In the first of these cases,
the case of Hofner and
Elser, we see that the court stated
that the concept of an undertaking.
Encompasses every entity engaged
in economic activity, regardless
of the legal status of the entity,
and the way in which it is financed.
In other words,
we have a very broad definition of
what amounts to an undertaking.
But in Pavlov, the court added to this,
by stating that it also includes
any activity consisting in the offering
of goods or services on a given market.
These are all the economic activities for
the purposes of being an undertaking.
And finally, so as not to labor the point,
in the case of Wouters,
here we see the court saying
that the competition rules,
do not apply to activity which,
by its nature, its aim, and
the rules to which it is subject does not
belong to the sphere of economic activity.
Or which is connected with the exercise
of the powers of the public authority.
Almost the reverse, here we were
looking at those undertakings,
which are unlikely to fall
within the scope of Article 101.
And we can see here, that,
that generally means public authorities.
Any other undertaking engaged
in economic activity, and
the offering of services or goods.
Is likely to fall within this broad
interpretation of the concept undertaking.
You should also remember that Article
101 applies not only to agreements and
concerted practices between two or
more undertakings.
It also applies to decisions of
associations of undertakings.
So, for example, a trade association
does not have to have a commercial or
economic activity of its own to
be subjected to article 101(1).
101(1) may well be applicable to
the decisions of a trade association,
even if it does not
apply to its agreements.
Because the association does not enter
into an agreement as an undertaking.
So you can see here we have this very
broad concept of an undertaking,
which really sucks in and
brings in almost any activity that
has an economic element to it.
The second element in relation
to 101(1) again requires us to
look closely at the case law coming
from the European Union courts.
And what does it mean by an agreement or
a concerted practice?
Well in the case of Bayer the general
court reviewed the case law,
from around the Union on
the meaning of an agreement.
And for the general court this concept
centered around the existence of
a concurrence of wills
between at least two parties.
The form in which that concurrence
rule is manifested is unimportant,
so long as it constitutes a faithful
expression of a parties intention.
What does this mean?
Well, a legal contract, of course,
would qualify as an agreement.
But so too would so-called gentleman's
agreements, or simple understandings.
Even though these are not, strictly
speakly, speaking, legally binding.
But there is no requirement
that an agreement be
supported by so-called
enforcement procedures.
What about concerted practices then?
Well, concerted practices
rarely establishes the case for
combat, which is not attributable
to an agreement or a decision.
These may within themselves
amount to an infringement.
For example, the very popular case
of the Dyestuffs, food dyestuffs.
And this surrounded a number
of producers of dyestuffs.
Who were accused of price fixing
through concerted practice.
In other words, they came together.
They spoke about what prices to put their
products out in the market for, and
what charges to make for
the services they undertook.
There was no agreement.
There was no conclusion of the contract.
And this became common practice,
amongst these organizations.
This is a concern of practice.
And the court has said concern of
practice is a form of coordination,
between undertakings which,
without having reached the stage
where an agreement properly so-called
has been concluded knowingly
substitutes practical cooperation between
them for the risks of competition.
Again a very wide definition
we see coming from the courts,
both of agreement,
as well as concerted practice.
We see that these all
encompassing interpretations.
Capture the activities and
the agreements of undertakings however
they chose to participate in
anti competitive behavior.
Let's be honest,
companies engaged in unlawful activity
are hardly likely to write it down.
And bring such a contract into a court to
enforce against one of their partners.
And certainly they don't want to write it
down into an agreement to later be used
against them in a court as evidence
of their anti-competitive behavior.
That's the second facet.
The third, of course, is this question of
effect on trade between member states.
Now, in line with what we've already seen,
the history of this concept, both
by the Commission and the European courts,
has seen the adoption of a very legal and
liberal interpretation of
the so-called interstate trade clause.
The enlargement and this great
scope that this clause is given,
means a lot more cases are likely
to fall with inside Article 101.
In other words, more activities
by undertakings, where they in
some way have an impact on trade
between member states is likely to
fall within the competence of
the European Union competition laws.
And we see that the concept of trade is
not limited to this traditional exchange
of goods and services across borders.
It's a much wider concept.
And in relation to this affecting
trade between member states.
We see that all activity, including
the establishment of undertakings,
of agencies, of branches,
all subsidiaries in other member states,
all fall within this
concept of affecting trade.
In other words, you don't necessarily
need to have the traditional good passing
over a border in order for there to be
an effect or trade between the member states.
Because the concept of trade
also covers situations, where
the competitive structure of the market
is effected by agreements and conduct.
So, effecting or solidifying a particular
market in one member state may well
change the over all competitive structure
on that market within the union.
Meaning that you need not
necessarily have to have
a cross border element in order for the
competition on the market to be distorted.
Very wide again and
here we can really see that
the European Union competition rules
become very, very encompassing.
The final question that we need
to really look it however,
is whether or not the agreement or
practice has by it's object or effect.
The prevention or distortion of
competition within the internal market.
The wording of the article itself 101,
doesn't make clear what we
mean by object or effect.
But the case law has in some
ways tried to illuminate.
What we mean by these particular notions.
I should point out that
these are alternative and
not cumulative requirements for the
finding of an infringement of Article 101.
And when we are speaking of the idea
of distorting competition by object,
we see,
in the case of GlaxoSmithKline services,
the court said that in order to decide
whether an agreement restricts by object,
regard must be had inter alia to
the content of its provisions.
We need to really look at the agreement.
We need to establish the objectives
that the agreement seeks to attain, and
the economic and legal context,
of which it forms part of.
According to the court,
in T-Mobile Netherlands,
it need not cause
an anti-competitive effect.
It need only potentially distort
competition on the market.
So again, very wide.
Just by object, you could be found to have
infringed European Union competition law.
Put another way, agreements that
have as their object the restriction
of competition will satisfy this point
of article 101(1) by mere existence.
The concept of effect on the other hand,
applies where,
from the agreement, it does not have the
object of the restriction of competition.
In other words it's not clear from
the agreement that the intention of
the parties is to restrict competition.
Here it is a little bit more difficult,
to establish whether or not there
has been an effect on the market.
And this requires a higher burden
of proof of the commission.
To bring before the courts and
to bring the evidence,
to illustrate the actual effect that
the anti competitive behavior or
agreement has had, on the relevant market.
So taken together these are the four key
elements that we need to have in place
in order for us to say that article
101(1) has indeed been engaged.
And in the event that we have a case
where all of these are satisfied,
then we could have the situation
where a particular agreement could
be found automatically void under
article 101(2) that of courses,
quite a severe thing to happen
in a commercial environment.
But even if the company is found,
or companies are found to have
infringed article 101(1),
they can have it declared inapplicable.
Where the criteria set out in
Article 101(3) are satisfied or
the companies fall under
a relevant Block-Exemption.
What do I mean by 101(3)?
Well 101(3) provides a legal exception
to the prohibition in Article 101(1).
By providing that it may be declared
inapplicable in respect of agreements,
decisions, or concerted practices,
or of categories of agreements,
decisions, or concerted practices
that satisfy four conditions.
So 101(3) has four cumulative conditions,
that an undertaking
will need to satisfy in order to
have 101(1) deemed inapplicable.
The first of these is that
the agreement must contribute to
improving the production or
distribution of goods.
Or to promoting technical or
economic progress.
While allowing consumers a fair
share of the resulting benefit.
The other two are this,
the agreement must not impose
on the undertakings concerned.
Restrictions which are not indispensable
to the attainment of these objectives,
nor afford such undertakings
the possibility of
eliminating competition in a substantial
part of the products in question.
As I said already,
these are cumulative and
they all need to be satisfied
if 101(3) is to be applicable.
So, 101(1) catches
anti-competitive behaviour,
101(2) voids such agreements,
and 101(3) offers
a potential legal defense, if you like,
to the application of 101.
Well, hopefully this has provided you with
a helicopter view of Article 101 TF, TFEU.
And of course there is
much more debate and
consideration surrounding
the application of this article,
as well as the applicability of the so
called block exemptions.
But time prohibits us from
dealing with these in more depth.
There is additional reading which has
been attached to this lecture, and
I encourage you to follow up on this
reading to get greater understanding of
the issues that remain
surrounding Article 101.
And the application of the block
exemptions, which fall very much and
stem from and flow through Article 101(3).
