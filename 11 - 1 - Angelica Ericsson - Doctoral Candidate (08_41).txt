Angelica Ericsson.
What a pleasure to catch you here
during your brief visit to Sweden.
And we are going to try to introduce
yourself in preparation for
your sections in the MOOC course.
How would you like to present yourself?
>> Yes.
Well, I'm from around here.
I did my basic studies in Lund,
my legal studies.
I was one year in Paris where I realized
that EU law was something I would like.
When I came home I did my
master thesis in EU law.
I participated in the European
law moot court, and and after
that it all, all went just EU law,
all the way.
I I've been for
various periods in Luxembourg, working for
the Court of Justice, where I actually
have a position right now as well.
That's why I'm only here for today.
and-
>> You, you have a tenured position.
You're actually-
>> Yeah. [LAUGH] >> You're living 
in Luxembourg, yes.
>> Yes, I am.
I'm living in Luxembourg.
I'm working for
the Swedish judge at the moment.
Which is a very nice position.
>> What do you mean by working for, in what capacity?
>> Well, every judge has four
lawyers working for him.
Doing legal research, drafting judgments,
and I'm the junior one,
so I'm the where, one who's there  to learn and, but it is very nice.
>> And, you're not only in Luxembourg, but
you are actually a doctorate
student here at the Lund faculty.
>> Yeah sometimes I call myself a,
a EU law seasonal worker.
I, I, I work at the court but
then I also come to university where
I've I do my Ph.D here and
I've also been teaching a lot.
I've been coach for the moot court.
And I, I very much enjoy the,
the academic work as well.
>> What is your scientific work about?
-
>> 
>> Your dissertation
to be.
>> Yes.
>> What is,
what area are you going to cover?
>> Well, the area is very general.
I mean the, I'm going to come to what
I teach in the MOOC as well, but
I am interested in how EU works, how it
works in relation to the member states.
>> 
>> And specifically how, how the body of
EU law works when it's produced by the ECJ,
by the Court,
what kind of standards the Court produces.
And I'm looking at a specific area,
where the,
where the member states have large margin
of discretion, and what kind of standards.
>> And what specific area is that?
>> Oh, well, I couldn't
actually pinpoint a specific area.
That, that's, the point of my thesis,
in a way, that you can find it in very,
very specific areas whether it's
transporter health care services or
national monopolies,
retail monopolies for example,
but what I'm looking at is
the phenomena rather than the area.
>> And what phenomena?
>> The phenomena of the court of justice.
>> Mm-hm.
>> in, in an area where there
is no statutory demands.
>> Mm-hm.
>> In a sense, in non-harmonized areas,
large margin of discretion
from the member states.
But when the ECJ
actually moves in and sets demands,
very specific demands on, on transparent
structures reasoned opinions, appealable-
>> Mm-hm.
>> Decisions, and so forth.
Very specific ones.
>> Mm-hm.
So we are talking about
fundamental rights in a certain sense.
>> Procedural fundamental rights,
yes, you can call them that.
>> Yes.
What, now is 2014,
when are we going to see the results?
>> Oh I have a deadline, 2019.
>> 2019, okay.
So that-
>> But it, it also takes a bit longer
since I'm working in Luxembourg as well.
>> And there might be
articles produced on the way?
>> There might be, we'll see.
But I'm also, since I
like EU law in a, in a general manner,
I tend to say yes to things which doesn't
have to do with my thesis, either.
So, for example, I worked on,
the aftermath of the â‰ˆkerberg-Fransson case.
And I have an article on the ne bis in idem.
So, I go over what happened
afterwards in Sweden, basically.
>> Those two articles,
also about fundamental principles
in the EU law, published?
>> Yes, but published in,
in Sweden, but in English.
>> Very good.
>> You are involved in the MOOC.
You're giving two lectures in the MOOC.
>> Yes, uh-huh.
>> On what?
>> Well it, as I said, it does reflect
that I have a general interest.
I, I'm not so much into
a specific substantial area of law.
I mean, you will meet a lot of people
who's interested in competition law-
>> Mm-hm.
>> Or labor law, or environmental law.
Whereas, I'm more interested
in how the EU works.
>> Mm-hm.
>> What kind of tools you have for
the implementation of EU law.
So I have a rather big lecture in
the beginning where we're looking at
the basic principles of EU law,
of supremacy and direct effect.
>> Mm-hm.
>> What, what gives EU law effect?
Why does it matter?
>> Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
>> And then I have a, a smaller lecture,
which is bit more specific about
the principle of legal certainty.
>> Mm-hm.
>> And, and
how that works in the EU legal order.
>> Students who are doing your classes,
what should they expect to get out of it?
>> Well, it is really in the beginning.
>> Mm-hm.
>> So I,
 hope that they get
a better feel of what EU law is.
>> Mm-hm.
>> I mean, I know that there might
be students who are not from the,
from Europe, who are not from the EU.
And try to get a feel of
this this legal order,
which is, you know, somewhere in between.
It's not really
an international legal order.
It's not really a federation.
And how does it work?
>> Would it be fair to say that
you're trying to create a basis for
further studies,
the lectures that come afterward?
>> Definitely, definitely yes.
And hopefully spark an interest,
but we'll see.
>> Do the students have to 
prepare themself for study in your class?
>> No, I mean not, not in general.
I mean 
when you look at the lecture,
there will be references to reading
materials or cases which you can go on-
>> Mm-hm.
>> And learn more about,
but the lecture in itself is supposed
to give you something already,
which you shouldn't have to prepare for.
>> You are inspiring the students
to go on, within your field, and
make further steps.
>> Hopefully, yes!
>> I am asking all the teachers
here about the present European,
Europe crisis, if I may call it so.
>> Yeah, yeah.
>> And
to what extent it has
an impact on their field.
What about the present European,
European crisis and fundamental rights.
Do you see any impact?
Anything that affects what you're doing?
>> I mean, it's tricky.
It's a tricky one because I, I mean,
I do deal with the fundamentals.
>> Hm-hm.
>> Which should at least in
theory stay the same.
I mean, direct effect in supremacy
should still exist, but then, of course,
there could be slight changes of how
it's perceived in the member states or
the fact that the EU pushes further for
further integration if there's a lot
of instability in the union, so-
>> Do you think that the EU at
present is pushing further, or
is it rather holding back and we have more
of a nationalistic trend at the moment?
>>  I think that's a very
difficult question, actually.
I, I think there might be,
actually, multiple trends at
the same time in different areas.
So,-
>> We, we probably have to follow
your lectures and think about it.
>> Yes.
>> And maybe we can arrive at
certain conclusions.
>> Please do.
>> Thank you.
>> Okay.
