Our client, the company we told you
about in the introduction lecture,
has recently contacted us
because it wishes to know how to
obtain a design protection for
the appearance of a product.
The company also informed us
that it was an employed designer
which created this good design.
My answer to this client will
depend on the client's needs and
other commercial factors.
As for example, which country is
the company's relevant market?
How many years the client
needs protection, and
how much money the client can
spend on the protection, and
how competitive this sector of the
industry is that the client operates in.
I'm interested in these
questions to be able to grasp if
the client needs a registered design
protection, or, if it is enough,
with a cost-free, shorter,
unregistered design protection.
A good design often helps the company
to increase market value, and
therefore has a strong commercial impact.
In other words, it's often plays an
important role in the company's economy.
And it can also make it easier for
the company to find business partners or
invest in the business.
The justification for a design protection
can, in broad sense, said to be twofold.
First, it encourage investment in good
design for the benefit of society.
And second, it gives creators incentives
in the form of recognition and
fair economic rewards.
Design could also be said to be
a form of culture expression, and
therefore important to protect.
There are different rules that the company
can take to obtain design protection.
They can apply for
protection directly to individual
countries with separate applications.
The national laws of EU member states
on design protection is harmonized on
the basis of the directive 98/71/EC
of the European Parliament and
the council of the 13th of October 1998
on the legal protection of designs.
But the directive is not
a full scale approximation of
the design laws of the member states.
Provisions on sanctions, remedies,
enforcement were left to national laws.
Member states also remained free to
fix procedural provisions concerning
registration, renewal, and
invalidation of design rights,
and provisions concerning
the effect of such invalidity.
There are also possibility to apply for
a community design.
Which means that the company can protect
the design throughout the whole
EU with just one application.
In this case the company gets
a unitary community right
on the basis of the council's
regulation number six.
A community design has
a unitary character,
it has equal effect throughout
the whole community.
The application for a community
design is made to the Office for
Harmonization in the Internal Market, and
the company gets a registered community
design if the application is approved.
A national register design, or
registered community design is valid for
five years from the date of filing.
But it can be renewed in blocks of five
years, up to a maximum of 25 years.
This regulation also contains rules
on a short-term unregistered design.
An unregistered community
design is possible to
obtain if the design is made avail,
available to the public in the EU.
It is valid three years from
the date on which it was made
available to the public within the EU.
The protection cannot be
extended after three years.
Except that the term of
duration is shorter,
there's also another drawback with
the unregistered design and that is,
that an independent creation will always
be a defense in an infringement case.
One shall be aware of that
this substantive provisions of
the regulation on design law are aligned
with the respective provision in
the design directive.
And the directive is implemented in
the member states' national laws.
As a consequent, the substantive
provisions of specific design protection
on the national as well on the community
level are followed congruent.
If the company wants to protect
their design outside EU,
there is also possibility to use the Hague
System for international registration.
The System provides a solution for
registered designs in
over 62 territories through filing
one single international application.
