Hello again.
In the previous class we pointed to
three instances, showing the high
relevance and impediments of
environmental law in EU Business Law.
Here, we're going to consider how
environmental law, or an environmental law
inquiry, is constructed in this
particular European legal context.
To start with, it is important to note
that the study of environmental law is not
just about finding straightforward
solutions to saving particular,
areas environmental areas, animals, or
more generally,
making the world a better place.
It is a complex subject,
that requires us to think carefully about
environmental law, and law more generally.
To illustrate this point,
as an example, look at this apple.
Now consider, also as encouraged
in your further reading list,
how did this apple end up
in my local store in Lund?
Did it have to pass any quality tests
before accessing the internal market?
Did the seller have to comply with
any information about the apple and
its production?
Was the apple organically farmed or
were pesticides used?
Is it genetically modified?
And how do rules,
EU rules on GMOs fit the broader
international trade liberalization?
How was it transported?
Was bio biofuel used?
Was the biofuel subsided?
Was the farm subsidized
where it was grown?
And if so, how does that
comply if at all with EU law?
These different strands of inquiry paint
a broad picture of questions that may
arise and that are relevant in studying
and applying environmental law.
Especially in a European business context.
To unpack these questions it is crucial to
understand the nature of
environmental problems as a start.
This means investigating
is it of collective nature?
That would be the case for
climate change which results from various
causes, each complex in it's own right.
Or is it rather an issue
concerning the commons?
That would include the management and
control of water, air, and
land, which are open to all.
Another focus could be
the increasing human population.
The focal point would then
again be slightly different.
This first line of inquiry is
important as that it frames how we
see the environmental problem and
how we then, later, tackle it.
In studying carbon markets,
I discovered that these are seen to
remedy distinct environmental problems.
One was the need to stimulate the market.
Another was substituting state
control of the commons, or
a third was a simple revision of
traditional environmental law.
These different framings of
the environmental problem leads to
different legal constructions of carbon
markets being proposed and furthered.
The second issue is to identify
the corpus of environmental laws that
apply to the environmental problem.
And more importantly, to understand
that often these laws represent
a fusion of influences from diverse
collection of laws and legal cultures.
This means that you,
as an environmental lawyer, or
as a lawyer in a European business
context, need to have good knowledge
of all the relevant legal frameworks and
legal ideas that operate in them.
Here the EU Emissions Trading Scheme,
the EU carbon market,
makes an interesting study.
It was introduced in the EU legal
order following the Kyoto Protocol and
subsequently international
environmental laws and agreements.
In the EU it was enacted
as a directive in line with
the EU legal order and competences.
It was implemented in the national
legal systems through national laws.
Understanding how these different
legal frameworks fit or
even clash is crucial in following,
following environmental inquiries through.
The third point is to appreciate
that the understanding of
environmental problems and
the corpus of law and
policy that applied to these is
a very complex exercise in itself.
To clarify this point,
let us again return to carbon markets.
Debates on these are cross dis,
disciplinary.
All the economist and economic analysis
mainly dominate the discourses.
To respond and
contribute to this debate on carbon
markets imposes certain challenges for
us as lawyers.
For instance, it requires mastering
particular methodologies, require,
required by specific disciplines.
For example in the case of climate change,
understanding scientific data,
or in other cases understanding
economic analysis, and
being able to translate these
findings into a legal framework.
This exercise is not straightforward.
And it's made harder by common
dichotomies expressed in the framing of
market mechanisms, for instance.
It is often perceived as
a regulatory strategy that is
distinct from direct regulation
on the basis that carbon markets
operate according to market
mechanisms as opposed to
being state controlled which direct
regulation is assumed to be.
The effect of such a distinction
is to construct an image of
markets as distinct from the state or
more dramatically from law.
What this means is that important
overlaps between, for instance,
judicial discourse or legal discourse and
market constructions are overlooked
just as a complex and dy,
dynamic relationship between markets and
the state in the context of carbon
markets are oversimplified.
So to sum this up, environmental law
is a challenging subject to study.
But tackling these, these challenges is
what makes the engagement with
environmental law rewarding.
