>> Hello.
>> Hello.
>> Eduardo Gill-Pedro.
>> It was guilt paro.
>> Yes.
Very welcome to our law library.
We're going to talk
a little bit about you and
your contribution to the MOOC on European
law that we are doing here as a faculty.
Maybe as an introduction.
Eduardo Gil Pedro doesn't
sound very Swedish.
>> No, no it is actually Portuguese, but
also Gil is not very Portuguese either.
So I am both Portuguese and
British of nationality.
Born in Portugal,
lived most of my life in the UK.
So I am now living in Sweden.
>> Mm.
>> So I am what, what might be called a,
a European.
>> For how long have you been in Sweden?
>> For four years now.
>> Why on Earth would someone leave
Portugal in order to live in Sweden?
>> One falls in love with a Swedish woman.
>> Okay.
I, I think I heard that before.
>> [LAUGH].
You are teaching a segment here
which is related to your research.
May, maybe we should talk
about your research a bit.
What, you are presently writing
a doctoral dissertation.
>> Yes.
>> What is it about?
>> I'm, I'm writing a doctoral
dissertation on the subject of
the adjudication of
fundamental rights in EU law.
So I'm looking at how fundamental
rights should be adjudicated in EU law.
And I come at this, not as a new lawyer,
but as somebody who has a background
as a lawyer in the U.K. As a common law
lawyer working with fundamental rights
both in domestic law and in
the European Convention on Human Rights.
So I'm looking at, at EU law from the
perspective of somebody that also is aware
of these other regimes of human
rights that exists in Europe.
>> Mm-hm.
>> And it's a very interesting time
to be doing that.
>> Do you have a practical background?
>> Yes.
Yes.
>> You, you didn't talk about that before.
>> I, I didn't.
I, I,
I was too busy talking about my love life.
[LAUGH] I, I, I taught,
I studied law in the UK and, and
then I trained as a barrister and
I worked for NGOs for two NGOs.
An environmental NGO and a human rights
NGO on issues involving civil liberties,
rights of participation,
that kind of thing.
>> Now you come to Sweden in order
to complete a PhD in the area of
fundamental rights.
European fundamental rights.
>> Yes.
I changed lane from domestic and, and
European convention law to EU law with
a masters here actually in Stockholm and
now I'm doing a PhD looking specifically
at, at fundamental rights in EU law.
>> You are teaching here
at the faculty as well.
>> Yes.
>> What are you teaching.
What kind of subject.
>> A wide range of subjects.
Mostly EU law.
So both at the, at the first
stage of the law program here and
at the advanced stage of the,
the Swedish law program but also in the,
in our master's of European business
law as well as our master's of
international human rights
law we have here at the unit.
>> You, what is your contribution to
this MOOC that we are jointly doing?
What, what are you working on?
>> I, I, I, I am in the subject, in,
in the segment which we call
the constitutional principles.
and, and there I talk at three very
important principles, and in two segments.
The, the first two principles there the
principle of conferral and the principle
of subsidiarity and the second is
the principle of non-discrimination.
>> And when the students
have started your segments,
what do you hope is
the learning outcome for them?
>> Well the first two principles,
conferal and
subsidiarity, what I wish the students,
to, to, to get from it is,
is an understanding of the relationship
between the National Legal Orders.
>> Mm-hm.
>> Between the Member States, and
the EU Legal Order.
>> Mm-hm.
>> So
how power is transferred, is confired
from the member state to the EU and
also a bit of an understanding of
the role of the European court of
justice which is a fundamental
importance in EU law.
And in particular how it can limit and,
and, and control the exercise
of it's powers by the EU and make sure
that the EU acts within it's legal powers.
>> Talking about conferal.
With all the others,
I'm talking about the Euro
crisis and how it's impacting
on their different subjects.
That's actually a fairly good
question to ask you as well.
To what extent is the present
unrest in European collaboration,
effecting fundamental principles and
conferring.
>> I, I think that the questions of,
such as what powers have been conferred
by the member states to the EU become
much more acute and much more pressing.
When the EU takes such
a prominent role in, in, in, in,
in taking on itself, particular
measures to resolve the crisis that,
that member states might feel are,
are, infringing on,
on their own prerogatives,
on their own sovereign prerogatives.
So, so I think that the crisis
has made this question even
more pertinent than it has been.
>> Is there a pendulum here, swinging it
back and forth, where you see more and
more powers conferred, conferred to
the community, or it is coming back?
>> I think there is a reaction.
Also, I think, when one can sense
an awareness on the part of the court and
also the EU institutions that.
Perhaps we need to be careful here and
we need to, to acknowledge and
respect that these powers
are not powers that we have.
But powers that have been conferred
on us by the member states.
And so, so there might be, one might be
able to identify, in the case law and
in the discourse generally this type
of reaction that let's not go too far.
Let's make sure that the EU and
the member states stay in step.
>> Sounds very interesting.
Thank you very much indeed.
>> Thank you.
It's been fun.
