As you already know, state aid is
according to Article 107 in the treaty on
the functioning of
the European Union prohibited.
However, there
are exceptions to this rule.
And during this lecture,
I will explain what kind of
state aid that is permissible.
I will start with the generals and
thereafter discuss the concept,
services of general economic interest.
It must be pointed out that the European
commission has an important role
in deciding what kind of state
aid that is permissible.
State aids can affect the conditions for
competition on the internal market.
It's therefore, very important that state
aids, even if they are beneficial for
the society are granted on the same
conditions in every member state.
This makes a centralization of
the state aid control system necessary.
And very much in the hands
of the commission.
All state aid shall, therefore,
as a starting point,
be notified to the Commission and
the member states must wait for
clearance before they can
accord aid to an undertaking.
However, in certain situations,
an aid does not have to be notified.
One general exception exists for
small amounts of aid.
According to the so-called de minimus
principle, eight of the 200,000 Euros
granted over a period of three
years do not have to be notified.
Such aids are presumed to
have an insignificant impact
on trade between member states and
should therefore not be considered to
constitute aid within
the meaning of article 107.
Furthermore, it is possible that an aid
falls under a so called block exemption.
These exemptions have been
designed by the Commission and
concern certain categories of aid.
If all the conditions mentioned in
a block exemption are fulfilled,
the aid is considered to be compatible
with the internal market and
does not have to be
notified to the Commission.
There are block exemptions for
small and medium sized Enterprises,
Training, Employment, Environment, etc.
A special category of aid is any support
of services of general economic interest.
There is a special demi misregulation for
this kind of aids, and
also block exemption decision.
Better we come back to that
at the end of this section.
It is now time to look at
the treaty base exemptions.
The treaty articles are also the basis for
the group exemptions.
We find them in Article 107 2nd and
3rd paragraph.
The second paragraph makes
clear that aid having a social
character granted to individual
consumers is permissible.
The same goes for
aid that is granted in order to
make good the damage caused by natural
disasters or exceptional occurrence.
The third paragraph
provides that an aid may be
permissible under certain conditions.
This is first aids that
promote the economic
development of underdeveloped areas.
This is areas which are regarded
as particularly backward,
in accordance with Union criteria.
Second, aid that promote execution of
the important project of common European
interest or intended to remedy serious
disturbance in the economy of the amnesty.
Third, aids that facilitate
the development of certain
activities or areas.
And finally, aids that promote culture.
The word may in this article implies
that before these aids can be granted,
the commission must approve them if there
are no applicable group exemptions.
Finally, I will give a broader
view on the important concept of
service of general economic interest.
It has a special relevance
as regard state a law.
The concept is mentioned in Article 14.
In the treaty, this article stress
the important place occupied by
services of general economic interest
in the shared values of the union.
They are also important in promoting
social and territorial cohesion.
The union and the member states,
each within their respective powers,
shall therefore take care that such
services operate on the basis of
principles and conditions which
enable them to fulfill their mission.
Services of general economic
interest is a dynamic concept
which can vary from member state to
member state, and also with time.
The member states have discretion
to decide which services of
general economic interest
they wish to promote.
Typical services are postal services,
broadcasting, education, and healthcare.
That brings us to the question
of financing services of
general economic interest.
An article that is very important in this
regard is Article 106, second paragraph.
It provides that undertakings and trusted
with operation of service of general
economic interest, shall be subject
to the rules contained in the treaty,
in particular to the rules and
competition.
But only in so far as application
of such rules does not obstruct
the performance in law or in fact or
the particular task assigned to them.
The possible use of Article 106, second
paragraph as regards the financing of
services of general economic
interest has been discussed at
several occasions by the court of justice.
One very important case
is the Altmark case.
In this case origin in Germany wanted to
keep running a bus line that was
not fully economically viable.
It therefore gave the company
some additional financing in
order to run the line.
The court was requested to decide
whether the additional financing
constituted state aid.
And if that was the case,
if it could be permissible in accordance
with Article 106, second paragraph.
The court found that compensation for
a service of general economic
interest is not state aid and
that it was therefore not necessary
to use Article 106, second paragraph.
However, the court developed several
conditions, which all must be fulfilled
in order to make sure that the
compensation can be considered as a fair
compensation for the extra costs
involved in the public service mission.
If found taking is granted,
overcompensation.
It resists state aid and
not doing the compensation.
Accordingly, the court said that
public subsidies are not state aid
where such subsidies are to be regarded
as compensation for the services
provided by an undertaking in order to
discharge public service obligations.
But this is only true if
four conditions are met.
First, the undertaking must
actually be required to
discharge public service obligations and
those obligations must be clearly defined.
Second, the parameters on the basis of
which the compensation is calculated.
Must be established beforehand in
an objective and transparent manner.
Third, the compensation must not exceed
what is necessary to cover all or
part of the costs incurred in providing
the service of general economic interest.
Finally, where the undertaking which is
to provide this service is not chosen in
a public procurement procedure, (that is
to say, on market conditions), the level
of compensation needed must be determined
on the basis of an analysis of the costs
which a typical undertaking, well run and
adequately provided, would have.
This judgment was welcome in general,
but it was not without controversy.
It is difficult for the member states
to fulfill all these conditions,
especially when it comes to old systems
developed without any knowledge of
the conditions stipulated in Altmark.
The commission has therefore
complimented the case
from the court with a rather complex
package composed of four different acts.
First, there exists a non-binding
communication on the application of
the state errors as regards services
of general economic interest.
This communication clarifies the view of
the commission on the Altmark case, and
other important developments in the case.
Second, there exists
a regulation on de minimis aid,
granted to undertakings providing
services of general economic interest.
In this regulation,
the de minimis amount is 500,000
Euros over a period of three years.
It is thus higher than the ordinary de
Minimis rule stipulating 200,000 Euros.
Third, a decision exists on
the application of article 106 2nd
paragraph regarding services
of general economic interest.
This is a group exemption decision.
If the conditions in
this decision are met,
no notification to
the commission is required.
Finally, the framework exists for
state aid in the form of public service
compensation, is complement the decision,
but state aid covered by this framework
must be notified to the Commission before
it can be granted to an undertaking.
All this gives the member
state more possibilities to
finance services of
general economic interest.
But they're also complex and
require a lot of work and
analysis at the national level.
That brings us to the end of this lecture.
Thank you for your attention.
