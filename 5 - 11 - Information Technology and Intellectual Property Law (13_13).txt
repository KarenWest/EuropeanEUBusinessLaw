Welcome to this lecture on intellectual
property law and information technology.
In today's society,
everyone has a relation to the Internet.
This is not a lesson on Internet
history or Internet technology, but
it is important to remember that
the modern commercialized version of
the Internet is a quite recent phenomenon,
and that intellectual property law,
in general, was developed long before
the Internet came to existence.
Simultaneously, it is important to
note that intellectual property law
has proved to have a strong ability
to adapt to new technology.
Not the least copyright
that has managed to survive
several groundbreaking technological
leaps during the last 100 years.
For instance, distance communication
by phone, radio, and television.
Reproduction, by way of photos and
cameras, send recordings and
moving pictures.
Thus, it is likely that
intellectual property law will
survive the challenges
posed by the Internet.
But there is a need for adaptation,
and that is an ongoing process.
A first question is how the Internet
poses problems to IP rights?
It may be self evident, but it is never
the less worth while to reflect on.
A starting point is a reminder that there
is an almost exponential increase in
value as to IP rights.
And that these rights
are extremely well suited to fit
the need of the information society.
This increase in value leads
to an increase in interest and
more attentive proprietors.
Simultaneously, there is an increased
need to use, and new means to use and
share creations, and
this equals potential problems.
The second reflection will be
the fact that there may be
problematic situations when territorial
intellectual property rights
are being used in a borderless
environment, like the Internet.
Among other things, this means
that every day transactions may be
international transactions with inevitable
questions asked to jurisdiction and
choice of law as a result.
A third problematic feature is the fact
that digital technology has made it
possible to reproduce at low,
on the verge of no cost,
with no loss in quality, or
even with improved quality,
as may be the case when a digital
music file is copied and enhanced.
A fourth feature relates to technology
development and so called convergence.
This is a general and modern problem in
law that may be illustrated by the use
of a smartphone, that are not only
advised for distance communication.
But also a computer, a computer
game console, a television set, and
a radio, to mention only some
of their potential uses.
This is, for obvious reasons,
a major improvement for the user, but
it poses problems for the legislature
who needs to rethink and adjust.
It is, in relation to the example, not
relevant to have separate legislations for
radio and television, and another for
digital communication when all
technologies appear in the same device.
Problems with convergence affect in
different ways the possibility to
adopt legislation to
intellectual property rights.
Perhaps more important than a realistic
perception as to the threats that
IT may pose, is an awareness as to
the possibilities that IT bring forward.
Many of the problematic features
of the Internet may as well be
framed as positive aspects.
New means to share creations
is not only a problem but
indeed a possibility to access and
share culture.
It also provides
a completely new arena for
creative achievements and
collaborative creations.
In relation to this development,
the evolution is in an initial stage.
The sun has just begun rising.
It is impossible to predict what
new features the future will bring.
Just some years ago,
no one had heard of Google, Facebook or
Twitter, and no one had used Spotify,
Netflix, or iTunes.
The only thing that may be
stated with certainity is that
actors that adapt to development, and that
learn to take advantage of technology,
may prove to be really successful.
More specifically,
as to intellectual property rights, and
information technology, there are several
issues that may be highlighted.
This course is not the place for
an in depth discussion.
But, at the same time it would have been
deceptive not to draw your attention to
some topical issues, in the intersection
between information technology and
intellectual property rights.
Web 2.0 is an expression that
emphasizes that the Internet is no
longer a static information platform,
but an interactive social environment,
where a service providers and users are
interacting in the creation of content.
The most obvious examples of this
development are social media, for
instance, Facebook,
Instagram, and Twitter.
Intellectual property rights
becomes relevant for instance in
relation to rights to photos that users
are posting on social media sites.
Another example is the collaborative
creation of Wikipedia.
A genius service, but
also a service where traditional
copyright is almost impossible to apply.
Jurisdiction and choice of law becomes
relevant when cross border problems are to
be solved by courts.
For instance, disputes that
relates to more than one country.
There are separate lectures
on jurisdiction and
choice of law within this course,
so I will not develop this.
However, it is important to note that
many of today's court cases on these
points surrounds intellectual
property rights conflicts.
For instance, file sharing, cross-border
use of databases and keyword advertising.
Consequently, there is a close
relationship between intellectual property
law and private international law.
In the realm of copyright,
there is a protection for
computer programs,
including computer games and
databases, both of which are used to
a large extent in cross-border networks.
Consequently there are several
decisions from the European Court of
Justice that deals with computer
programs and databases.
Some of the issues that have been
discussed are how a computer program is to
be protected.
And when the use of a database
in one jurisdiction may lead to
infringing effect in another.
One additional topical issue is
keyword advertising, which is smart,
directed advertising that is
linked to a specific search term
used in different search engines.
The smartness is that this provides
users with unique possibilities to
differentiate advertising.
If you are selling spare parts for
cars, you may link your ads to different
relevant search words, for instance car.
And your ad will pop up when someone
is using that keyword to search for
information about cars.
The user is likely to be more
than average interested in cars.
And the advertiser will only
have to pay in relation to
the impact of the advertising.
So, at the end of the day,
everyone is winning this game.
However, problems arise when someone is
using the technology to link
ads to protected trademarks.
One famous case from the Court
of Justice dealt with such a use
of Louis Vuitton's famous trademarks.
And there are several cases on
keyword advertising from the court of
justice from other countries in Europe and
around the world.
Free speech and access to knowledge and
privacy are in several instances regarded
as fundamental adult human rights,
protected on the highest level.
Simultaneously, but perhaps not equally
clear copyrights are protected.
So when intellectual properties are being
infringed on the Internet more and
more often fundamental rights are being
used as arguments, both for and
against IP rights protection.
I will not develop the argument
during this lecture, but
I would like to emphasize that there is
an ongoing debate that is nourished in
the realm of fundamental rights,
that deals with the use of intellectual
property rights on the Internet.
One example out of several, is when
Internet service providers refuse to
reveal identity of file sharers
that have been using their service,
with the augment that
the information is person and
that an exposure of information
would infringe privacy.
Simultaneously, proprietors are arguing
that information should be revealed due to
the fact that their property
rights are being infringed, and
that their fundamental property
rights should prevail.
In the midst of this conflict
you are likely to find
an Internet service provider.
So at the end of the day, internet service
provider liability maybe regarded as
the most topical issue in relation to
IP rights and information technology.
As is perhaps evident from
the brief discussion so
far, there are several
potential conflicts.
Any casts already been
stated that proprietors of
today are more attentive to infringements.
One major problem is lack
of effective enforcement.
Without going into further details
as to enforcement, it, it suffers to
conclude that there are problems
in identifying infringers in open,
occasionally, anonymous environments.
The single user, for
instance, the uploader,
the advertiser, the downloader,
may prove to be impossible to identify.
So then it's much easier to
identify the service that a single
actors has been using in order to perform
their potentially infringing acts.
Considering this, it is not far fetched
to realize that proprietors may be
interested in Internet
service provider liability.
And to what extent ISP's may be regarded
as contributors to infringements.
Due to the fact that they are facilitating
infringements by providing the necessary
service for the primary act,
the primary infringement.
This is complicated law and
I will not develop this further.
It is, however, important to be aware
of the development in this area of law.
And the fact that this impossible to
escape the question of ISP liability, if
intellect property rights and information
technology issues are to be investigated.
One conclusion in relation to this
is that the last word has not
been uttered on ISB liability.
And there are upcoming issues.
Many of the problems that
we have identified so
far deals with ISP liability.
Keyword advertising, the right to be
forgotten and privacy issues in general.
This was a brief overview of issues,
an introduction to
a theme that would suffice for
one course on its own or even several.
You will be able to find plenty of
material regarding this information
technology and intellectual property,
and much is available on the Internet.
The point here is not to go into
details but to show a development.
As technology is converging,
law is becoming more and more complex.
And it is no longer possible to separate
one area from other areas of law.
The Internet brings it all together,
in areas that have been separated.
One example would be copyright and
privacy are now closely linked in
an information technology context.
If this lecture has managed to emphasize
this relation, I would be a happy teacher.
