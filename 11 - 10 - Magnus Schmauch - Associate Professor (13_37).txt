Magnus Schmauch.
>> Uh-huh.
>> Very nice to have you here in.
>> Thank you.
You are making substantial contributions
to our [INAUDIBLE] course in
several different areas, and therefore
we are curious to know who you are.
Eh, could you please present yourself?
>> Of course.
I am university teacher.
Used to be active here in but I'm
currently active in in the North Sweden.
I'm also of council at the law firm in
Stockholm that I specialize in EU law and
the fields of law which I will also
present here in the course such as stated.
>> But you have a practical
background as well, you've be out,
you've not only brought up with in the,
the law facility.
>> Of course not,
even though I am a little, alumni.
>> Mm-hm.
>> And very happy and very proud to be so.
I spent a number of years in
Luxemburg where I was working for
the Court of Justice of the European union
but also a short period at the Efbacourt.
>> For a long period?
>> I would say about eight years.
I started as a translator and
while I was writing my PhD,
then I started to be
a Legal Secretary at the chambers of
Madam Lynn, the Swedish judge
in the chambers at the time.
>> Penny Lally?
>> Penny Lally exactly.
>> Mm-hm.
>> And while with her I finished my PhD.
Once that was wrapped up,
I got an offer from the after court
that I could not refuse as they say.
>> Mm-hm.
>> So I spent a year and
a half at that institution as well.
Working for the Icelandic judge.
>> What does it mean to say that
you're working for Penny Lally, or
the Icelandic judge,
what actually did you do?
>> Well as a Legal Secretary,
you're responsible for
the drafting of that particular cabinet.
That is to say the group of,
of professionals that work with and
for the judge.
That means that the communications that
go with the other judges in written form.
But also draft documents,
draft reports, and
draft judgements are produced
by legal secretaries.
>> So you supported Penny Lally
in her making judgements.
>> Exactly.
>> Did Penny Lally support you
in making your dissertation?
>> Oh, no I would certainly not say so.
>> Mm-hm.
>> I wrote my dissertation for
Karl the President of the Eftacourts.
I wrote it as a student of
the Zangalane University in Switzerland.
>> Mm-hm.
>> And I had to.
Jangle the two,
if you want to put it that way.
>> And the theme of your dissertation was,
state aid and aviation industry?
>> Yes.
I wrote my dissertation
about state aid to airlines.
>> And there has been substantial
problems in that area.
With member states supporting
the national carriers.
>> Yes there has been and
as a matter of fact,
I choose the field partly
because aviation transport
is a field that is traditionally
marked by heavy state intervention.
>> Mm-hm.
>> At the same
time it is one of those
fields that are today,
subject to the most fierce
competition between different actors.
And what was interesting to see,
was how do these fields interact.
And that's also why I call my.
Dissertation, a study in law policy and
economics.
>> Mm-hm.
>> Because all these three fields come
together very strongly in state aid law,
but
in particular when it
comes to air transport.
>> And the,
the language of the dissertation was?
>> English.
>> English.
>> I wrote it in English.
>> You wrote it in English.
>> Yes.
>> When, when did you deliver it?
>> It was printed in 2012.
>> 2012.
>> 2012.
>> Have you been writing
elsewhere on European topics?
>> I have.
I have published my some articles on
the relationship between the European
convention of human rights and EU law.
And the role of the European court
of human rights in Strasberg,
how they have to relate to the application
of human rights law in EU law.
>> And what are you presently involved in?
Are you are you doing a research
project at the moment?
>> Well presently I am focusing very much
on the on the application of the charter
of fundamental rights and the convention
of human rights in a Swedish context.
>> Mm-hm.
>> That is to say that,
I am currently looking at how
national law traditionally applied.
And traditionally interpreted carries
different meaning today as we need to take
into account human rights documents that
are coming in from, from outside the.
Traditional legal context, if you like.
>> Are you looking at the charter at the
same time, or just a European convention?
>> I am looking at both.
I think that today is important
to take all of them into account.
But also to take the national level
into account at the same time.
>> Mm-hm.
>> EU law, and also human rights law,
in the convention of human rights,
they are nothing without the national
context at which they take place.
>> It sounds like you are interested
in constitutional law.
But then again, you're dealing
with aircrafts and aviation.
Are you constitutionalist or
are you more of a materialist?
>> I hope to be able to call myself
a constitutional materialist.
>> Mm-hm.
>> In the sense that I think that you need
both to be able to understand the system.
The system is shaped by its constitution
but, at the same time, the constitution
can only be understood in the light of
the reality that it actually creates.
>> Does this show in your education
when you, what are you teaching?
>> Oh, I am,.
>> Not just in the MOOC, but regularly.
What kind of subjects are you teaching?
>> I am mostly teaching EU law,
but also civil procedural law.
>> EU law sounds on
the constitutional level,
or are you also dealing
with the material matters?
>> Actually I'm trying to cover both.
>> Mm-hm.
>> I have been engaged as a teacher in
EU law in various courses in this MOOC,
but also in in, in
>> Mm-hm.
>> Some of those courses
which are specialized, for
instance property law and so on.
>> Mm-hm.
>> And I always endeavor to
provide my students with the angle of
European law that is the most useful for
them in their specific context.
That is to say, if I teach property law,
I do not teach about, anything about the
institutions or the constitutional setup.
>> Mm-hm.
>> But I,
what I do is that I go into detail
on the material rules of EU law,
which are of relevance for them.
>> Mm-hm.
>> For instance.
When it comes to consumer protection
abusive clauses in consumer contracts
where we have seen some very interesting
developments recently that are related to,
to ownership and
the use of property and so on.
>> A fairly broad approach,
is that also the case in this MOOC?
Are you,
you're covering several different things?
>> Yes I do.
>> Wh, what, what are you
actually covering in the MOOC?
>> I want, almost wanted to say there
are so many I lost, I lost track.
>> Okay.
>> But I am involved in the general
principles in the competition part.
I have some sections on state aid.
I also do the free movement.
And then, finally,
I cover the external relations.
>> Mm-hm.
And, what.
Should the student expect from going
through your defense sections,
where would you like the students to
be after having studied your material?
>> I hope that this MOOC, will give the
student a first glimpse of European law.
The format lends itself very well to
a broad presentation of the topic.
And I would be very happy if it
would lead to the students to find
an interest to go further, to study
these issues more, more in detail.
>> Mm-hm.
>> The excellence of this MOOC I think,
is its broad approach to many different
fields, both on a constitutional and, like
you mentioned before, a material level-
>> Mm-hm.
>> More specifically.
And I hope that the students will be able
to see that European law is not just,
an abstract constitutional
theoretical study,
but that European law today permeates
the European legal systems.
All over across the board.
All the way if you like from
the constitutional to the material level.
>> mm-hm.
>> And if the students find something
which they want to take with them,
I would consider this MOOC a success.
>> Sounds very good.
The eh.
In terms of continue, continuing studies.
Did u do your self studies you
make references perhaps in
your lectures to additional reading?
>> Yes I do.
>> Or they simply come to Europe and
study a master.
Here in one or the other country,
perhaps here in London.
>> Yes.
I mean,
that would be the most appropriate
form it, to be perfectly honest.
You have to under, you have to be
in Europe to understand Europe.
>> Mm-hm.
I'm asking all the teachers involved in
the MOOC, about the present Euro crisis.
And how it is affecting their areas.
It's a little bit more
difficult to ask you,
because you have to respond both
from a constitutional level and
perhaps, if there is any
material science that you see.
But, how would you respond?
Is there a Euro crisis at the moment?
>> But, it's difficult to deny
that there is a Euro crisis.
When it comes to an example, I would say
it would be the easiest to take state aid.
>> Mm-hm.
>> Which was also the topic
of my dissertation.
Which was fundamentally for
instance saving the European
banks in around 2008.
What we have seen instead is
that the Commission has left.
The old approach of the late 9,
of the 1990s, and the late
1990s treating state aid
as a ban on state aid.
And instead trying to regain
a policy initiative in relation to
the member states.
>> Mm-hm.
>> By trying to.
Reshape the discussion into state aid
as a tool to promote growth in Europe.
>> Is, there is a constitutional
dimension to this as well.
More subsidiarity.
>> Yes, indeed.
What is interesting is that.
This approach is showing itself in
the different commission regulations,
and so on.
For instance, the general block exemption
regulation that was adopted this year,
2014, is a first step along the way.
But, otherwise, the commission retains.
A very high degree or,
of of discretion, in these matters.
>> Mm-hm.
>> But it remains to be seen exactly,
how far this development will go.
>> It'll be very interesting
to look at your lectures, and
see how they fit with this presentation.
Thank you very much, Minus.
>> Thank you, [INAUDIBLE]
