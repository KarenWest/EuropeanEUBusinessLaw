Hello, and welcome to a lecture on
one of the fundamentals of EU law,
the free movement of capital.
As you know,
there are four freedoms in EU law
linked to the free movement of workers.
Services, the freedom of establishment,
and last but
not least, the free movement of capital.
The free movement of capital constitutes a
necessary support for the other freedoms.
A transaction in goods or services, or
establishment in another member state,
will often require investment and
necessitating a capital
movement across borders.
Before you continue,
please familiarize yourself with
the text of article 63, 64 and 65 TFEU.
The prohibition of restrictions on
the movement of capital, aim at more than
eliminating discrimination based on
the nationality on the financial markets.
It precludes all rules, which would
make the free movement of capital
illusory by preventing market participants
from investing in another member state.
Or by rendering it difficult for
undertakings to raise capital
in another member state.
Let's take a look at the treaty.
The rules on the free movement of capital
are laid down in Article 63 TFEU.
The provision is simple and
has two short paragraphs.
The first paragraph covers movements of
capital and the second covers payments.
The term movement of capital
in the first paragraph,
does not only cover investments and
loan, but also inheritances and
certain tax deductions linked
to gifts in money or in kind.
The term movement of payments
in the second paragraph
concerns transfers of foreign exchange
as consideration for transaction.
And not as in the case of capital
movements to investment of
the funds in question.
Here we also note one particularity
with a free movement of capital,
it's link to third states.
That is, non-member states.
The relations to third countries
are laid down in Article 64 TFEU.
Article 64 TFEU covers the free
movement of capital to third countries.
I will be brief on this provision.
The article contains three paragraphs.
Most importantly,
we see that the free movement of
capital is not a given freedom.
But one which is to be introduced through
legislative measures by the EU Legislator.
The necessary measures shall be
taken by the European Parliament and
the Council using the standard
legislative process.
According to Article 64(3) TFEU, and
this marks a departure from the otherwise
pretty one-way-street-principle of
EU law towards steeper integration.
The council acting with a special
legislation procedure, and
after hearing the European Parliament
may unanimously adopt measures,
which constitute a step backwards
as regard to liberalization.
Another set of measures is
available in article 66, TFEU,
regarding temporary safeguard measures,
in the case of serious difficulties for
the operation of economic and
monetary union.
These measures can only be enforced for
six months.
They are taken by the council on
a proposal by the commission, and
after consulting
the European Central Bank.
But there are also justifications for
member states to restrict
the free movement of capital.
The grounds for justification of
restrictions to the free movement of
capital, looks slightly different
from the justifications we note for
the other three freedoms of movement.
Restrictions can be justified
on grounds of general interest,
including the grounds for exceptions
set out in Article 65 of the TFEU.
And other mandatory requirements.
According to Article 65(2) TFEU,
the provisions on the free movement of
capital are to be without prejudice
to the applicability of restrictions,
on the right of establishment which
are compatible with the treaties.
Article 65-1 TFEU,
may seem to open the way for the member
states to distinguish freely between
national taxpayers and foreign taxpayers.
However, a distinction between two
situations can only be made if
the situations are indeed
not objectively comparable.
Moreover, such a distinction
can be justified by
overriding reasons in the general
interest, in particular,
in relation to the coherence
of the tax system.
Further, the court of justice
also applies a rule of reason.
Restrictions can be justified, and
thus compatible with the treaties,
on grounds of general interest.
This is provided at there, not applied in
a discriminatory manner and do not exceed
what is necessary in order to achieve an
object, objective in the general interest.
Other than the cohesion of the tax system,
which we mentioned already in
the context of Article 65.1 TFEU.
Such an objective in the general interest
covers such objectives as town and
city planning, public housing policy,
agriculture and
forestry holdings, preservation of jobs in
forestry holdings in case of inheritance.
And the promoting the use
of an official language.
Economic grounds can not
justify restriction.
The measures must be proportionate.
They must be based on objective
non-discrimanatory criteria which
are known in advance.
Obviously, if it concerns
movements to a third country.
A restriction could be justified,
even though such a restriction would not
have been justified within the union.
So, this marks the end
of our presentation of
the free movement of
capital within the EU.
I hope it has given you
some insight in this issue.
Thank you for tuning in,
and see you soon again.
