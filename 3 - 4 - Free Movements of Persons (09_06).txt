The free movement of persons, is and
workers is a policy chapter
of the European Union.
It is part of the free movement of persons
and one of the four economic freedoms.
Freedom of movement for workers shall
be secured within the community.
Such freedom of movement shall entail the
abolition of any discrimination based on
nationality between workers of
the Member States as regards employment,
remuneration, and
other conditions of work and employment.
It shall entail the right,
subject to limitations justified on
grounds on public policy,
public security, or public health.
A, to accept offers of
employment actually made.
B, to move freely within the territory
of member states for this purpose.
C, to stay in a member state for the
purpose of employment in accordance with
the provisions governing the employment of
nationals of that state, laid down by law,
regulation or administrative action.
And d, to remain in the territory of
a member state after having being
employed in that state,
subject to conditions which shall be
emboarded in implementing regulations
to be drawn up by the commission.
The provisions of this article shall not
apply to employment in the public service.
So, the write of free movement have both
horizontal and vertical direct effect.
Such that as a private citizen
can invoke the right, without in,
in an ordinary court against other persons
both governmental and non-governmental.
The meaning of Worker is a matter of,
of a European Union law.
The essential feature of an employment
relationship, however, is that for
a certain period of time,
a person perform services for and
under the direction of another person in
return for which he receives remuneration.
So the purpose,
the purpose under the case law.
The rights of free movement of workers
applies regardless of the worker's purpose
in taking up employment abroad, so
long as the work is not solely provided as
a means of rehabilitation or reintegration
of the worker's concern into society.
The time commitment, the right to free
movement applies to both part-time and
full work, time work.
So long as the work is effective and
genuine, and not of such small scale,
irregular nature, or limited duration,
to be purely marginal and ancillary.
Remuneration.
Well, a wage is a necessary precondition
for activity to constitute work.
But the amount is not important.
The right to free movement applies
whether or not the worker required
additional financial assistance from
the Member State in which to he moves.
Remuneration may be indirect quid pro quo,
that is board and
lodging, rather than strict
consideration for work.
Direction of another.
Well, when a person is self employed,
he can avail himself of the freedom to
provide services, and
freedom of establishment.
So, EU citizens are entitled to look for
a job in another EU country,
work there without needing a work permit,
reside there for that purpose, stay there
even after employment has finished.
And enjoy equal treatment with
nationals in access to employment,
working conditions and
all other social and tax advantages.
Either nationals may also certain types
of health and social security coverage
transferred to the country in
which they're going to seek work.
That's the coordination of
social security systems.
Through rules on the social
security coordination do not
replace national systems
with a single European one.
All countries are free to decide who is to
be an, an insured under their legislation,
which benefits are granted,
and under what conditions.
The EU provides common rules to
protect social security rights for
citizens when moving within Europe.
That's the EU 28 plus Iceland,
Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland.
Who do these rules apply to?
Well nationals of the EU, Iceland,
Liechtenstein, Norway, or Switzerland
who are or have been insured in one of
these countries, and their family members.
It's stateless persons or
refugees residing in the EU, Iceland,
Liechtenstein, Norway, or
Switzerland who are or
have been insured in one of these
countries, and their family members.
Citizens are covered by the legislation
of one country at a time, so
they only pay contributions
in one country.
The decision on which country's
legislation applies to the person
involved, will be made by
the social security institutions.
You cannot choose that part.
The citizens have the same rights and
obligations as the nationals
of the country.
Whether you're covered.
This is known as the principle of
equal treatment or non-discrimination.
When they claim a benefit,
the previous peers of insurance, work or
residence in other countries
are taken into account if necessary.
And if they are entitled to
a cash benefit from one country,
they may generally receive it even if
they are living in a different country.
This is known as the principle
of exportability.
The regulations on
modernized coordination,
that's regulation 883 from 2004,
and 987 from 2009, apply.
So, who can benefit from this freedom?
Bullets, job seekers.
That is EU nationals who move to
another EU country to look for
a job under certain conditions.
It is EU nationals working
in another EU country.
It is EU nationals who
return to their country of
origin after having worked abroad.
Family members of all
the above situations.
But rights may differ somewhat for people
who plan to be self employed, students,
retired, or
otherwise economically nonactive people.
The rights described apply of people who
exercise the right to free movement for
work purposes.
There are limitation based on
considerations on public security,
public policy, public health realms,
and employment in the public sector.
People working in some
occupations may also be able to
have their professional
qualifications recognized abroad.
We call it the mutual recognition
of professional qualifications.
There are posts reserved from nations
in EU countries that are allowed to
reserve certain public sector
positions for their own nationals.
This is an exception to the general
rule of free movement of workers and
must therefore be interpreted res,
restrictively.
Only posts involving direct or
indirect participation in the exercise of
public authority and duties designed to
safeguard the general interest of
the state may be restricted to nationals.
These criteria must be assessed
on a case by case basis,
taking into account the tasks and
responsibilities covered by the post.
For other posts not restricted to
nationals, nationals of other EU
countries must be treated in the same way
as nationals as regards access to posts,
which is recruitment proceedings, working
conditions such as salary and grade,.
And also recognition of professional
experience and seniority.
So when people apply for
public sector posts in
other EU countries they may have
difficulties getting recognition for
professional experience and
seniority acquired in other EU countries.
However, public sector
employees must take account of
previous periods of comparable employment
acquired at, in other EU countries.
Both for recruitment and for
determining salary, grade,
and other working conditions.
These peers must be considered in the same
way as professional experience and
seniority acquired in the host country.
And on a general level, EU citizens and
EEA citizens have the right
of free movement and
residence across the European Economic
Area as long as they are not an undue
burden on the country of residence and
have a comprehensive health insurance.
This right also extends to close family
members that are not EEA citizens.
After five years, the right of residence
becomes permanent which means it
does not depend on any
precondition any longer.
This permanent right of residence
can be seen as a precursor to
true European citizenship.
