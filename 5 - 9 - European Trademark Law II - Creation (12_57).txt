Welcome back.
I hope that you by now have figured out
how to manage our HIMS search tools,
and that you have a result
from your trademark search.
For the purpose of this course, we assume
that the trademark that we are interested
in is available, and that a company
wants to go through with a registration.
A trademark is, as a general rule,
a registered right.
And registrations
are relatively affordable.
And the registration may be
renewed on innumerable occasions.
A trademark right, in other words,
may be described as a perpetual right.
However, not all signs can be registered
as trademarks in the first place.
For a registration to be approved,
the trademark applied for
must meet certain requirements
in trademark law.
And consequently,
there is a need to investigate
the prerequisites for protection.
The starting point for
such an investigation would be
Article 2 in the Trademark Directive.
As is evident from this provision,
there are two prerequisites
that must be fulfilled.
First, a sign must be capable of
being represented graphically.
And in addition to that, a sign must
be capable of distinguishing a good or
a service, and this is, in other words,
to have a distinctive character.
The fact that a trademark
needs to have a distinctive
character indicates that behind lying
core value that a trademark protects.
Namely, the commercial link that
exists between a trademark and
its users, which is all potential
buyers of the goods and
services that are marked
by this trademark.
As long as this link exists,
distinctive character is at hand, and
trademarks may be justified.
In this regard,
a trademark is a valuable asset
that communicates crucial
information to potential buyers.
Simultaneously, a trademark
may pose problems for
other actors that operate on the same
market, selling similar products.
In order to facilitate effective
competition, it is necessary to have
open and searchable trademark registries,
so that other actors,
competitors can investigate if a sign
may cause confusion on the market.
This is one of the prevailing
arguments in favor of
the prerequisites that a trademark
must be graphically represented.
There must be a possibility to visualize
the trademark so that others can
take the trademark into consideration
when planning their marketing strategies.
In a majority of cases, it is easy to
represent the trademark graphically, word,
figures, packaging, etc.
But modern trademark law embraces
new ways to identify goods and
services by the use of music, sound,
videos, movements in general.
And there are new forms of trademarks,
sound marks, and
movement marks just to
mention some examples.
Which poses problems in relation
to graphically representation.
And there is an ongoing
discussion as to the need to
rephrase these requirements
in trademark law,
and that it should be possible to
visualize a trademark graphically.
But irrespective of whether or
not this prerequisite will be replaced,
the underlying principle remains.
It must be possible to represent
a trademark in a clear and
perceptible way if protection
is to be justified.
As to our company and its trademark,
it is definitely possible to
represent this trademark graphically,
it's a wordmark.
And we can assume, at least for
the purpose of this course,
that it has distinctive character.
Still, we need to investigate whether or
not there are exceptions that
may create obstacles in relation
to the creation of the trademark.
As we discussed during the introductory
lecture, there is a threshold for
protection, meaning in
relation to trademark law,
that not all signs are viable for
protection.
Grounds for refusal to register
a trademark or to invalidate a trademark
that is already registered are dealt with
in Article 3 in the Trademark Directive.
An obvious ground for a refusal is
that the sign cannot constitute
a trademark in accordance with
the prerequisites in Article 2, which is
if it cannot be represented graphically
and or lacks distinctive character.
Further grounds for refusal are,
according to Article 3.1 (c),
if the mark consists exclusively of
[INAUDIBLE] indications which may serve in
trade to designate, for instance,
the kind, quality, quantity of the groups.
In other words, a trademark protection for
descriptive words is not justified, and
consequently, such words
are excluded from protection.
This is partly due to the need to allow
free speech and commercial communication.
Furthermore, a sign may not be
registered as a trademark if it
has become customary in the current
language or in the bona fide and
established practice of the trade.
All the grounds for refusal so far have
more or less dealt with distinctiveness.
A descriptive or
customary word is according to
the principal rule of trademark law.
Not distinctive enough to
be allowed protection.
This deficiency however
may be cured by youth.
And this is in accordance
with Article 3.3 where
it is made clear that a trademark shall
not be refused registration if it
has acquired a distinctive
character through use.
There are additional grounds for
refusal that are not curable by use.
For instance, Article 3.1 (e) that
deals with the relation to patent and
design protection, and clarifies that it
is not possible to register a sign which,
broadly speaking,
aims at fulfilling a technical function.
Furthermore, it is not possible
to register signs which are of
such a nature as to deceive the public,
or if the sign is
contrary to acceptable principles
of morality or public policy.
So what answer are we now going to
give to our client, the company,
as our trademark, being formal,
assigned that is viable for protection.
And that is, of course,
a hypothetical question.
But it is not far fetched
to conclude that it
is likely that this wordmark meets
the requirements in trademark law.
And that no exceptions are applicable
even if this wording is possible to
describe as a partly descriptive word.
Thus, let's assume that we have a valid
registration and that a company has
started to use this trademark
information in the course of trade.
Using or
exercising trademark is a right to
prevent others from using that
sign in specific situations.
However, it is not an absolute right.
The possibility to prevent
others can be limited.
And not all situations of use
amount to an infringement.
One of the most problematic
aspects of trademark law is to
learn how all those aspects interrelate.
What are the limitations and
when does someone else dues
correspond to an infringement?
So let's focus on the limitations first.
Limitations in trademark
law applies in relation to
the exercise of valid trademarks.
And they relate to the scope of protection
in as much as they impose restrictions,
in relation to the proprietor
by way of indicating
certain situations where others shall
be entitled to use the trademark.
One such example is that a third party
must be allowed in the course of
trade to use his or
hers name and or address.
The same applies in relation to
indications concerning the generic
expressions, kind, quality, and
quantity, but it is also accepted that
a third party shall be allowed to
use a trademark where it is necessary to
indicate an intended purpose of a product.
For instance, this is necessary
in relation to spare parts.
The observant viewer may have noted
that the limitations mentioned so
far mainly surround expressions
that are generic and or
descriptive and
consequently not distinctive.
Therefore, it is likely to conclude
that there should be no problem.
All the above mentioned
will not be protected by
trademark law in the first place
due to lack of distinctiveness.
And we need to recall that the fact
of lack of distinctiveness is
a curable round for refusal.
A general remark is that all limitations
in relation to the proprietor's right to
prevent others from using is that the use
that is to fall outside the scope
of protection must be in accordance
with honest practice in industrial or
commercial matters, which is stated
in Article 6.1, last sentence.
The final limitation to mention,
is the exhaustion of
rights doctrine that was mentioned
during the introductory lecture.
In relation to trademark law, this
principle is expressed in Article 7.1.
And it states that a trademark shall
not entitle the proprietor to prohibit
its use in relation to goods which have
been put on the market in the community
under that trademark by the proprietor or
with his or hers consent.
This may sound like a clear principle,
and it is, but it
is also a principle that may be prove to
be quite complicated to apply in practice.
Complications may arise
due to the fact that
Article 7 also includes
a limitation to the limitation.
In subparagraph 2,
it is stated that paragraph 1 shall
not apply where there exists legitimate
reasons for the proprietor to
oppose further commercialisation of
the goods, especially when the condition
of the goods is changed or impaired
after they have been put on the market.
The problem may be illustrated with
an example as to pharmaceuticals.
In this branch, specific problems arise
in relation to repackaging of medicine,
which is an operation
that is necessary for
the consumer markets that need specific
information in the local language.
Simultaneously, a proprietor
may argue that repackaging is
equal to a change that puts Article 7,
subparagraph 2 into play.
And this is the limitations
of trademark law.
Before continue with next lecture,
there is surprise for you.
There will be a possibility for
you to do an exercise which will be
uploaded on the course homepage.
This exercise deals
with a case law search.
And there is instructions for
you to follow and a possibility for
you to get more closely acquainted
with the Court of Justice.
And please do that exercise before
you continue with next lecture.
See you then.
