Good morning, Xavier Groussot.
>> Good morning.
>> We are now at the start of our MOOC,
which is an introduction
to European business law.
And, you and I,
we're going to talk a little bit about.
What is the purpose behind this course,
but, maybe as a start,
could you say a few words about yourself?
>> Yes, of course.
I'm originally from, from France, came to,
to Sweden many years ago
as a aerosmith student.
And basically, stay in Sweden after
my studies doing my PhD here, and
then starting as as a lecturer in in
I even become a Swedish national-
>> Are you a Swedish?
>> Two years ago.
So, I'm both French and Swedish and.
>> in that sense,
I feel I'm very European.
>> Mm-hm.
When did you go to Sweden and
why didn't you stay in Sweden?
>> Well, the, the main reason for
me coming to Sweden was for
studying international law
>> Mm.
>> And, the well then,
Baring Institute of of Human Rights.
>> Em, you made your Ph.D and you are now
an ordinary professor at the faculty.
You're a professor of EU law, you are also
our vice dean eh, and responsible,
I imagine, responsible for international
activities to a large extent.
>> Yes.
My role as a vice dean is to, develop the
internationalization of the faculty, and
also to, to develop,
the research of the faculty.
>> Uh-huh.
And of course you have
a special responsibility for
this course which is on European law,
yeah.
You are also responsible for
the Master program at the faculty.
>> Absolutely, yes,.
>> Yeah.
>> I am director of the Master of
European Business Law which is
a unique program in Europe,
in the European Laws.
A two-years program of,
of European law welcoming students
from all over Europe, but
also from outside Europe.
It is quite an effort that we
are doing here at the faculty in
organizing creating several ways.
And, why are we doing that?
What is the purpose from our perspective,
for
putting all these efforts into our group?
>> Yeah, well Monsieur,
there are many reasons as why
we are organizing such muck.
First of all, one important vision is
the dissemination of knowledge, and
more precisely, the dissemination of
the knowledge in Ukraine business law.
The,the course that we are offering here
at the Faculty of Law offers a broad
knowledge of Ukraine business law,
of practical and theoretical focusing
on essential aspects of European
business law such as competition law,
state dates, public procurement, tax law.
>> So, it's, it's a part of obligation
to spread the knowledge about
the European law, and we the faculty
is a bit specialized in Europe law.
>> Absolutely, and that will be a second
reason why we organizing such a MOOCs,
is to, to,
show what is the research at the faculty.
All the teachers involving the MOOCs
are teachers were also in doing research.
>> Mm-hm.
>> And, the,
the MOOCs presentation are closely linked,
closely related to what the,
the researchers does on a everyday basis.
>> So, we want to show that there is
research going on in important areas.
And, we're doing that partly
through dumunc as well.
Absolutely.
And, this is also, reflected in,
or Master of Ukraine Business Law.
>> And, what is that?
>> Well, it's a unique program in,
Ukraine Business Law.
Two years program where
all the teacher involve in
the moke are also involve in the teaching
of this Master of Ukraine Business Law.
Which is a master program involving
not only, Swedish, students.
But, also, student from,
all over the world.
>> Mm-hm.
So, you are saying we are doing this
partly because it's a mi, our mission,
to spread knowledge, internationally.
Partly, in order to show that we
are doing research in this field,
and we want to be a part of the research
discussions on European law.
And, thirdly partly, because we want
to advertise that we have a Masters
program and that students can take this as
a first step in to our Masters program.
>> Absolutely.
The marks to me is a perfect platform for
student, I mean,
no knowledge and you can enroll to
learn something business of youth and
business, and
take the domestic program afterwards.
But also, to me, it doesn't limit
itself to, to the situation.
It can be also open to, to, to, to student
who want to developed that knowledge
in European business law early without
taking the, the program afterwards.
>> So, a student would be someone who
is generally interested in knowing more
about European law, European business law,
who, or
who has an interest to come to Europe and
study, perhaps at our university, but
also at other universities in, in Europe.
This can create the basis for
them, if, if they would like to-
>> Absolutely.
>> Continue-
>> Absolutely.
>> With the master program.
You, I think one can hear from your
accent, and you said it yourself,
you are a French person,
>> Originally, yes.
>> From the beginning, at least.
>> From the beginning, yes.
>> From the beginning.
When I look at the names
of the faculty here.
>> Hm.
>> There are several people coming from
is internationalization
in itself important?
>> It's extremely important and
the faculty of law at, at university is
certainly the,
the most international faculty.
In, in Sweden and
this is reflecting in the,
in the people who are teaching in the or
in the Master of UPenn business law.
Many of us are coming from outside Sweden.
>> Mm.
So, it is, it is already
an international faculty that is in.
>> Extreme, extremely
>> Yeah.
>> internationalized and
it's an important part of I
would say the DNA of the
>> Mm.
>> faculty this internationalization.
>> Mm.
I have been talking to all the teachers we
have been discussing what they are doing
and one, one thing that comes
out of all the discussions is
that Europe is presently in a crisis.
And is there a Europe crisis when
you think about Great Britain.
It's fumbling at the moment.
And, the.
But, there's also discussions in
several place.
Do you believe that there is
a Euro crisis at the moment?
>> Well, it's difficult not to believe
that there is a crisis but historically
speaking Europe is born
out of a crisis and
many crisis have been facing
Europe since the start of Europe.
And Europe as Always been evolving,
developing through the crisis.
When we look at the present
situation in this Eurozone crisis,
or economic crisis this, this,
precisely reflect what I just mentioning,
in the sense that.
We do face a deep economic crisis.
But, what I find interesting is that this
economy crisis is followed by mutations
and Constitutional mutations.
S-,
in the sense that The, the,
the European institution, the states,
and the people are trying to find
a solution to, to this crisis.
>> Europe will develop,
again, to fit its crisis.
>> Hopefully, yes.
>> Yes.
And, that makes another very good
reason for Really going through
our mooch and
continue to study European law.
>> Absolutely.
>> Isn't that a good start for
the students?
Can they now embark on our book?
It is a very good start.
And, I think that the teacher involving
in, in, in the mocks ha, have been
taking this aspect into consideration,
meaning that the crisis aspect.
>> Mm.
>> And, as the student will probably
discover when they re-take the mocks there
is many crisis in many different field.
The law.
>> Mm.
So, let's wish
the students best of luck when
they now start their work.
>> Yes.
Good luck.
