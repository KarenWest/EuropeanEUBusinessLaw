In this lecture, we will examine what
criteria the company's design must be in
order to obtain protection.
We will base this on the articles
in the design directive and
the community regulation on design.
First, we have to know what the design is.
And according to European design laws,
that is the appearance of the whole or
a part of a product
resulting from the features.
And the product is an industrial or
handcrafted item.
A design can be protected by
a community design if it is new and
it has individual character.
The design should be considered new
if no identical design has been
made available to the public.
A design shall be deemed to
have been made available to
the public if it has been published
following registration or
otherwise, or exhibited,
used in trade, or otherwise disclosed.
The criteria that a design
has to meet to be new is not
an absolute criteria because the design
can, for example, still be new if one,
these events could not reasonably have
been known in the normal course of
business to the circles specialized in
the sector concerned within the EU.
Or two, if it has been made
available to the public as
a consequence of an abuse in relation
to the designer or his successor.
The design shall also not be considered
to have been made available to the public
if it has been disclosed to a third person
under conditions of confidentiality.
The law also contains a grace period,
which means that if the company has
disclosed the design, or in other words,
have made it available to the public,
there is still a possibility to register
the design within 12 month of disclosure.
And the same applies if
the design was published by
a third party without
the designer's consent.
The other criteria is that the design
shall have individual character.
The design has that if the overall
impression it produces on the informed
user differs from the overall impression
produces by any other previous designs.
In assessing individual character,
the degree of
freedom of the designer during development
shall be taken into consideration.
Designs are excluded which is
contrary to public policy or
to accepted principles of morality.
A community design is also excluded for
features solely dictated by its
technical function or must-fit features.
Protection is also excluded from
those component parts which
are not visible during
normal use of a product, nor
those features of such part which are not
visible when the product is assembled.
We have now learned the criteria for
protection.
The next question is what scope of
protection the right holder gets.
The answer is that the scope of protection
includes any design which does not
induce on the informed user
a different overall impression.
In assessing the scope or
protection, the degree of
freedom of the designer in developing the
design shall be taken into consideration.
In some, one can say that registered
community designs are protected against
similar designs,
even unintentional of infringements.
But the unregistered community designs
only protects intentionally copying,
and therefore, an independent creation
will be a defense in an infringement case.
Some acts can not infringe.
They are excluded from protection.
And that is, for example,
acts done privately and
for non-commercial purposes,
acts done for experimental purposes,
acts of reproduction for the purposes
of making citation, or of teaching.
There are also very important
rules of exhaustion of rights.
These say that the right conferred by
community design shall be exhausted if
the product has been put on
the market in the community by
the right holder with his or her consent.
That means that the right holder, for
example, cannot stop the resale of those
specific goods that have been put on
the market with his or her consent.
The design belongs to the designer.
If two or more persons have
jointly developed the design,
the right to the community design
shall vest in them jointly.
If a community design is developed by a,
an employee in the execution of his or
her duties following the instruction
given by his employer, the rights to
the community design shall vest in
the employer unless otherwise agreed or
specified under national law.
If our client decides to register the
design, it has to choose between domestic,
community, or
an international registration.
If the company is unwilling or unable
to get the registered community design,
the choice lies between
unregistered community design or
to protect the design by
a domestic copyright law
as the work of applied art or
work of artistic craftsmanship.
But one should be aware of that
EU member states have a widely
different attitude towards copyright
protection for product appearances.
