Welcome to this lecture
about EU legislation.
Today, we will look at secondary
legislation and the legal acts.
Where do I find it?
How do I get the right version?
And how do I read it?
There are different kinds of legal acts,
regulations, directives, decisions.
Regulations is a binding legislative act.
It must be applied in
entirety across the EU.
Directive, is a legal act that sets up the
goal that all EU countries must achieve.
It shall be implemented into
national law within a certain time.
It is up to the individual
countries to decide how.
Decisions is binding on those
to whom it is addressed, and
it is directly applicable.
I will use Council Regulation
(EC) No 1/2003 as an example,
as I know that you will be reading
this regulation during the courses.
Where do I find it?
A regulation number is
built up in a certain way.
First comes the institution
behind the regulation.
Then you find the letters EC,
which stands for European Community.
This was changed to EU when
the Lisbon Treaty came into force.
The first digits
are the numbers of the act.
The last past is the year
when act was accepted.
Let's go to the home page of EUR-Lex.
Fill in the number and
year and document type.
Searching with a unique number,
it will give you only a few matches.
The title begins with a Celex number.
This is a number that every legal
document within the European Union gets.
Beginning with the digit three,
it means that it is legislation.
This is the reference to
the official journal where
all legislation is published.
It includes name,
series number, date, and pages.
Link to the document text and
to more information.
This is a direct link to the text.
Or if you prefer, to the PDF.
This is the original
version of the directive.
If there are any changes,
they are not included.
To see them, you need to look
at the consolidated version.
You can find a lot of
information about the directive,
all divided under different tabs.
They are in the text and
different options of formats.
For example, About this document,
Procedure, and Linked documents.
Under About this document you can
find information like validity.
Under Linked documents you
find consolidated versions,
national implementation, links to
everything that is based on this document.
Or all documents mentioning this document.
Further down, you can also find the
consolidated versions of the regulation.
Make sure if the consolidated version
is something that you need, or
if it only concerns a certain country.
On the front page of EUR-Lex, you can
find a title, Legislative drafting guide.
Open this link, and you will get
guidelines for how to read legislation.
The title comprises all the information
in the heading of the act,
which serves to identify it.
Preamble means everything
between the title and
the enacting terms of the act,
namely the citations, the recitals and
the solemn forms which precede and
follow them.
The enacting terms
are the legislative part of the act.
They are composed of articles which
may be grouped in titles, chapters and
sections and
may be accompanied by annexes.
I hope you will find the legislation
you need for the courses now.
Why don't you go and
try to find some of them right now?
Good luck.
And thanks for your attention.
