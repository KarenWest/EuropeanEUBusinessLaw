Hello, and
welcome back to the Lund MOOC in EU law.
In this lecture, we are going to talk
about one of the original freedoms,
the free movement of services.
There are four freedoms which
have formed the basis of EU law.
The free movement of workers and
services, the freedom of establishment,
and the free movement of capital.
The free movement of services is
certainly one of the more important.
As usual I would like you to take
a look at the relevant provision in
the treaty before we proceed.
So please read through
Articles 56 to 62 TFEU.
Don't miss out the reference
to Articles 51 to 54 TFEU.
You should take a look at those too.
There are many kinds of services.
We live in a post-industrial society and
services are more and
more important in our economy.
As a result, the case law from the court
of justice covers a great number of
different situations.
Actually, the provisions on
the free movement of services have
spawned a number of
separate fields in EU law.
Such fields are, the posting of
workers and transporter banking.
The financial market will be presented
in another lecture in this MOOT.
I refer you to that lecture for
a good overview how the free movement
of services work in a specific field.
There are also important exceptions.
I mention one right here.
As you can see from Article 58(1) TFEU the
freedom to provide services in the field
of transport is governed by
the provisions relating to transport.
This covers rail, road and waterways but
not air transport which falls under
the general rules of the treaties.
The provisions of the free movement of
services not only apply to the action of
public authorities, but also associations
or organizations not governed by public
law, where they lay down collective rules
in the exercise of their legal autonomy.
This is particularly true where
services are provided across
borders without the provider or
the recipient moving.
The notion of services is wide,
but also of a residuary nature.
The notion of services covers services
not governed by other freedoms,
in order to ensure that all economic
activity falls within the scope of
the fundamental freedoms.
So, let's look at
the provisions of the treaties.
What is short is sweet and
Article 56 TFEU is one
of those short provisions that carry an
entire universe over two short paragraphs.
According to Article 56(1) TFEU,
restrictions on freedom to
provide services within the Union shall
be prohibited in respect to nationals of
member states who are established in
a member state other than that for
the person from which, for
whom the services are intended.
According to Article 56(2) TFEU
rules concerning nationals of
third country nationals who provide
services and who are established within
the union can be introduced by
the European Parliament and
the Council under the ordinary
legislative procedure.
Here we see the importance of
being a national of the EU.
Moreover, if you're not
a national of the EU,
at least you need to be
established in the EU.
One important aspect of article 56
TFEU is the cross-border element.
This means not only the provision of
services but also to enjoy services.
Thus if I provide a service
to another country or
if I go to another country
to enjoy a service.
These both situations
are covered by the treaty.
It does not mean that we have to
physically move across borders,
if I stay in my country and
you stay in yours.
And the only thing moving across the
border is a service that I provide to you.
This in fact is enough to
establish a cross-border element.
It may seem as if this covers everything.
That is not true.
Many daily transactions today are still
pure internal transactions, and
in such a situation
the treaties do not apply
because the cross-border
element is simply not there.
So, what is it we talk about
when we talk about services.
The notion of services is
defined in article 57 TFEU.
Services are normally provided for
[INAUDIBLE] in so
far as they are not governed by
the provisions relating to freedom of
movement of, for goods,
capital, and persons.
The provision specifically lists
activities of an industrial character,
activities of a commercial character,
activities of craftsmen and
activities of the professions.
Remuneration includes
services provided free of
charge if they are normally remunerated.
They do not have to be paid for
by the person for
whom they are perfored, performed.
They have to be paid by private money.
This leads to very difficult balancing
acts when it concerns public
services such as education,
medical services, and public housing.
Gambling is also considered a service,
even if the proceeds would go
straight to the government's pocket.
Some aspects may be covered by
another fundamental freedom due to
the residual nature of
the free movement of services.
According to the third paragraph
of article 57 TFEU, that person
providing a service may temporarily
provide a service in another member state
on the same condition as those
imposed by the state on its nationals.
This is depending on the regularity,
periodicity, or continuity of the service.
A person moving to another member
state falls under the freedom of
establishment if he intends
to set up shop permanently.
But how do we achieve this?
Well by harmonization.
These two provisions set out the rules for
harmonization through directives.
It was understood very early on that
directives were important tools in order
to create the level playing
field by removing ob,
obstacles to trade and red tape.
For instance, the legal profession is
subject to a limited harmonization for
the recognition of
professional qualifications.
A lawyer member of the bar in one
member State can exercise his
profession in another member State and
provide his legal services.
If a service has been
harmonized through a directive,
it is the directive that sets
the criteria for the assessment.
Actually, if there is a directive,
it takes precedence as Les Speciales
over the treaty provisions.
The principle of non-discrimination is one
of the fundamental principles in EU law.
We have been through the basics of this
principle during the introductory part
of this course.
Actually, instead of repeating it here,
if you think that you need a rehearsal of
that principle, do not hesitate
to go back and watch it again.
When you listened to that lecture,
you may have noticed that it
was linked heavily to general
abstract principles of EU law.
As a matter of fact, even though
the principal remains the same,
article 61 TFEU has Les Speciales,
takes precedence over article 18 TFEU.
So if it concerns discrimination in
the context of the provision of services,
it's article 56 and 61 TFEU that apply and
not article 18 TFEU.
That's easy to remember, right?
But what happens if a member state feels
the need to restrict the exercise of
the free movement of services, or
otherwise maintain
a discriminatory practice?
Sometimes there are situations where
a restriction on the free movement of
services may be justified.
Article 62 TFEU refers
back to articles 51 to
54 TFEU which concern
the right of establishment.
According to these provisions,
a restriction to the free movement of
services, may be justified on
grounds of public authority,
public policy, public security,
and public health.
Objectives of an economic nature can
never justify such a restriction.
Just as in the other freedoms
the ECJ has opened up
the possibility that the restriction can
be justified based on the rule of reason.
Such an example is the case Binsbergen
which you find in the course materials.
The test goes a bit like this.
First, the restriction must not be
subject to prior harmonization by EU law.
Second, it must concern a public interest.
There are many interests that have been
assessed by the ECJ in this context.
They include consumer protection,
fair trading,
combating fraud, protection of an official
language, and many, many others.
Third, the national rule must
apply without distinction.
This is an expression of the principles
of nondiscrimination and equality.
Fourth and finally,
the measure must not be disproportionate.
The measure must be appropriate,
necessary, and
may not go further than
the situation requires.
I refer to the lecture on proportionality
as a fundamental principle,
also available in this MOOC.
So dear watchers this was
the freedom to provide services.
There are many aspects that a short
lecture like this can not cover in
detail such as the labor law
aspect of this freedom, but
it will appear in more dedicated lectures.
Make sure to follow those.
And don't forget to come back and
watch these lectures again if you need to
refresh your memory or just simply
want to tie the threads together.
Thank you for tuning in and
see you soon again.
