Ulrika Wennersten.
Very nice to talk to you about
our joint MOOC course, and
you are, making several
interventions in the course and,
as a teacher on the course, we're,
of course, interested to know who are you?
>> Well, I am a.
>> How would you, could you
present yourself, perhaps, to us?
>> Well, yeah.
I'm a assistant professor
at the law faculty.
I have a background working,
before I came here in law firm and
also as a law clerk in the Court
of Appeal in New York.
But I wanted to specialize
in intellectual property, so
I took a leave from, from my job as
a law clerk in the court of appeal,
and I went to Quinmerry Westfield
college to Master, and
a Master in this sub grouping
intellectual property law.
>> And you were inspired to continue.
More or less like you want to inspire
other people now to get more involved in
intellectual property law.
>> Yeah.
How did you continue?
>> I continue with here a, with a Ph.D.
>> Mm-hm.
>> In intellectual property law.
And the Ph.D's-
[LAUGH].
>> Mm-hm.
>> Is dealing with all the different
intellectual property areas as-
>> Corporate design patent, and-e.
>> We're, we're looking at right now.
>> Yeah.
>> It is some book.
>> Yup.
>> It's a bit huge research
that you have performed and
you presented your dissertation in.
>> May.
>> In May.
>> Yeah.
>> This May.
So again, it, it still smells fresh.
What is the dissertation about?
It is not about intellectual
property law but you have zoomed in.
>> Yep, intellectual property law and
the protection of non-commercial
societal interests.
Noncommercial society interest.
>> Yeah.
>> What's a non-so, noncommercial
societal interest, what is that?
>> It's divided actually in two parts.
The first part deals with copyrights and
the perpetual right is Swedish Law,.
Well you can aft, aft, the,
the, end of the the,
the copyright ex, ex, expires.
You still have protection.
And not, don't commercial it pro,
protection for, for, for the work.
Are you talking about painters?
And
>> Yeah.
>> primarily photograph?
>> Yeah.
>> Yes.
>> And also music.
All, all the different areas
protects this, this [CROSSTALK].
>> So that's,
that's a non-commercial societal interest.
And then you said the second
part was about a difference.
>> Yeah,
the second part is about all the public.
And, and the morality.
Exception in the trademark,
design and patent law.
>> So, the order public stipulation
in intellectual property law?
>> Yeah.
>> Is,
is that really an important provision
in the intellectual property law?
>> Well, I, I assumed that it when I start
the project, that it wasn't so important.
But the project, I would say-
results, and my result is that in patent
law and in trademark law it's very
important, but not so
important in the law yet, I would say.
>> And, and what does it do-
it, it really balances interest, is that.
Importance of the course.
>> Yeah.
That's one importance.
That you can't get protection
from different kind of works
that actually is infringing in public or
morality.
>> Mm.
Infringing societal interests.
>> Yeah.
>> Yes.
So, that's how it fits, fits in.
Very interesting.
Eh, are you involved in eh,
a research project a the moment?
>> Em, not this moment.
But in, in spring I will be eh,
in another,
another project about the Max Lab 4 and
about the ES.
>> That's interesting.
>> E assistant.
>> That's part of the new
development here in loons.
>> Yeah.
>> This scientific giant labs that we
are establishing.
You have written other things as well, eh,
apart from the thesis during
your indoctrine period?
>> Yeah.
I've written the textbook.
>> Mm-hm.
>> In about Intellectual Property.
Like Intellectual Property in a nutshell.
>> Mm-hm.
>> It's,
it's not the Swedish title but
>> Mm-hm.
In what are you teaching
in the regular program?
>> I'm teaching intellectual property law.
>> Mm-hm.
>> Market law.
>> Mm-hm.
>> And general business law.
>> Mm-hm.
>> In different levels.
>> Mm-hm.
So your scientific interest is also
translated into your teaching.
>> Yeah.
>> Does it impact what
you are doing in the mooc here?
What are you teaching?
>> Teaching copyrights,
design law and patents.
Very well.
We look forward to looking
at your sections and
learning more about
intellectual property rights.
Thank you Ulrika Thank you
