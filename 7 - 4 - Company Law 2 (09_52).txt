Okay, let us return to our main story.
We have seen that rules regarding
the decision making authority is
a core element within
any kind of company law.
But this is not the only core element.
Another one consists of rules regarding
the representational authority.
You see, in order to have effect,
decisions have to be
implemented in action.
Someone has to execute the decisions
taken by the company, of course,
the company itself can not do anything.
Instead, the law has to
identify persons who
are empowered to represent the company,
otherwise, the companies simply couldn't
conclude any business contracts.
But as there have to be limits to
the decision making authority,
there have to be limits to
the representational authority too.
These limits define the conditions
under which agreements and
other legal acts are valid or not.
If they are invalid, they don't give
rise to obligations for the company.
But remember,
we are speaking here of situations where
a representant has acted
on behalf of the company.
Furthermore, these rules are connected
to the rules that organize and
limit the decision making authority.
Typically, the necessary condition for
invalidity is that
the challenged legal act isn't
based on lawful company decision.
Either it's not based on
a company decision at all, or
it's based on a forbidden decision.
So far, we have discussed two core
elements of the universal concept of
company law.
These are rules regarding
the decision making authority and
the representation authority respectively.
But I also want to stress a third and
final element.
This element consists of rules regarding
the responsibility of the company's debts,
of course, the company itself
is responsible for its debts.
Remember, we only speak of company
with legal personality here.
But other persons might as well be
responsible, for an example the members.
If the members in principle have
no personal responsibility,
it is common to speak of
limited liability companies.
The most famous example is
the company limited by shares.
As I earlier mentioned, this company
form is also called the corporation.
From a societal point of view,
the corporation no doubt is
the most important company form.
It has the largest impact of all company
forms on such things as economic growth,
the labor market, environmental
sustainability, and human rights.
Actually, it is no exaggeration
to say that capitalism, thus,
the world as we know it is virtually
unthinkable without the corporation.
As contrasted with other company forms,
the corporation builds upon
the idea of investor ownership.
Members of the corporations
are called shareholders, and
in virtue of the idea
of investor ownership,.
Shareholders are supposed
to regard their rights in
the company as a capital investment.
The ingenious thing,
with corporations, then,
it that they enable the meeting
of capital and productive ideas.
As is well known capitalists do not
necessarily have any productive ideas.
And people with good ideas do not
necessarily have the pockets.
I have already mentioned that the
corporate form is about as universal as
a company form can be.
Moreover, in general at least two
corporate forms are acknowledged,
private and public corporations.
Simply put, the distinction concerns
whether the shares are allowed to
be publicly traded or not.
On stock markets,
only public corporations are to be found.
As a consequence, private
corporations typically don't have as
many shareholders as public corporations.
Many private corporations
have only a few owners but
often the owners also function
as directors and employees.
Let us return to the question
of European company law.
Let me first say that when I speak of
European law, I mean European Union law.
When speaking of European company law,
it's important to distinguish between
two very different questions.
The first is whether there
are any European company forms.
The second is whether
European law has anything to
say about companies formed under national
company forms, in the member states.
At present, there is only one
clear cut European company form,
it is called The European company.
There is also another form called
the European Economic Interest Grouping.
But the latter form is something of
a hybrid between cooperative and
a partnership.
The European company, on the other hand,
is a public corporation.
It was introduced by a regulation in 2004.
Interestingly enough, European companies
are only partly regulated by European law.
According to the regulation,
many questions are governed by
National Public Company law in the member
state where the company is registered.
As a consequence,
there are as many types of
European companies as there are member
states in the European Union.
As of yet the European company
has not been a success.
At present, there are only
around 1,800 European companies.
To put this into perspective,
in Sweden alone there are around
450,000 corporations,
of course, the great majority of them
are small, private corporations.
Since 2008, there is also a proposal for
a European private company,
probably such a company form
will be introduced, one day.
But it remains to be seen,
to what extent it will be used.
Regarding company forms, then,
European law hasn't, as of yet,
brought about any substantial changes
in the landscape of company law.
Businesses within the European Union
is still largely conducted by national
companies, but this is not to say that
there is no European company law.
Instead, the existing European
law has taken other ways.
First, a European company
law dimension has been
created as a result of the quest for
harmonization on national company law.
Secondly, another dimension has
been created by developing some of
the fundamental rights provided for
in the treaty on the functioning
of the European Union.
In the following,
I will simply speak of the treaty.
Harmonization has been brought
about by a fairly large number of
company law directives.
Of course, these directives
must be interpreted in light of
case law from the European
court of justice.
However, to a large extent,
company law harmonization has
focused on national law applicable
to public corporations.
As I mentioned,
another European dimension is founded on
rights flowing from the treaty,
of paramount importance is the right of
establishment which also
includes companies.
The European Court of Justice has in
a number of cases expanded this right.
Due to this development,
the court has created an opening for
regulatory competition between the member
states with regard to company law.
Within some boundaries,
this means that it's
possible to choose which national
company that best suits your interests.
Subject to these boundaries, you can for
an example choose the law of a member
state A even though you only do
business in another member state B.
The consequence is that the courts in
member state B are obliged to apply
the company law of the member state A.
As could it be expected,
it's a matter of debate as to whether
this development is good or evil.
Those who say it's good argue that
the market will force all member states
national laws to converge upon
an optimal company law, and those
who say it's bad instead argue that the
convergence will be upon the worst law.
What will happen remains to be seen.
Thank you for listening.
