During this lecture,
I will concentrate on the most important
aspect of free momentum goods.
Article 34 or the treaty on
the functioning of the European Union.
Three cases from the Court of Justice
will be used as illustrations.
The Dassonville case, the Cassis
de Dijon case, and the Keck case.
You find the relevant cases in
the reading materials for this lecture.
Article 34 prohibits quantitative
restrictions between member states on
imports and
all measures having equivalent effect.
So the first question to ask is,
what is quantitative restrictions?
It is a kind of restriction on trade
that is not common in the Union today,
namely that a state limits the quantiity
of products that can be imported.
There reasons for such restrictions,
can be to protect the domestic industry
that produce similar kind of products.
We can leave that concept as it's
not important in practice nowadays.
What is more important is the expression
measures having equivalent effect.
Most of this lecture will concern
the scope of this expression, and
why is this scope so important.
There is a risk that everything that
can be considered to be a measure
having equivalent effect is covered
by the prohibition in Article 34 and
is therefore forbidden.
It is only if it's possible to find
the justification ground in the treaty, or
in the case or the Court of Justice
that such measures can be permissible.
The first thing to point out is that
it's the substance, that is to say,
the practical effect, which is important,
not the form of the measure.
It is often some kind of legislation
that constitutes a measure but
it does not have to be that.
In one case, quote Buy Irish, the state's
financial involvement in a campaign for
buying Irish products,
was considered to be
a measure having equivalent effect
as a quantitative restriction.
However, the state must
be involved in some way.
Private actions are not covered.
The involvement of the state
does not have to be active.
A member state can infringe
Article 34 if it failed to
take action against private actions.
In the so called Spanish strawberry case,
France was considered to breach
Article 34 when it did not take
action against French farmers, or
stop Spanish lorries carrying fresh
fruit from entering into France.
In the Dassonville case the Court
defined the scope of Article 34.
It said that this article covers all
trading rules which are capable of
hindering, directly or indirectly actual
or potentially intra Community trade.
As we have seen, it does not have to be
a measure we usually define us a rule.
The reference to trading rules
can also be other measures.
In some, the potential scope of
Article 34 is extremely wide.
Having said that,
it is important to point out, that all
measures falling within the scope of
Article 34, do not have to be prohibited.
There are exceptions for
measures which are justified by
the public interest grounds
in Article 36 in the treaty.
This article mentions public morality,
public policy, public security,
protection of health and life for
humans, animals or plants,
protection of natural treasures
possessing artistic, historic, or
archaeological value, and protection
of industrial and commercial property.
So far the situation is quite simple.
We have a wide prohibition and
we have some exceptions.
However, the Court of Justice has
also developed a balancing test,
in order to find a more efficient
way to assess what kind of
national measures that are allowed and
not allowed.
This test wa-,
.
was first expressed in the Cassis de
Dijon case.
In this case, the French black
currant liquor, Cassis de Dijon,
could not be imported
to Germany because it
had a lower alcohol content
than similar German products.
In Germany there was a legal
requirement that all
liquors should contain
at least 25% alcohol.
The German government advanced several
arguments in support of this rule.
And even if the Court of Justice didn't
consider any of them convincing,
this case is very important.
The Cassis de Dijon case is interesting,
because the German rule was
objective in the sense that it treated
domestic and foreign products alike.
In fact many barriers to trade in
the internal market are the consequence of
different national regulations
regarding product requirements.
The laws in the member states,
regarding the safety or quality of
products are not similar enough to create
good conditions for cross border trade.
A solution is to create
similar European rules
by harmonizing the different
national conditions.
But this process is slow, and cannot
be used for all national requirements.
The Court, therefore, invented
the principle of mutual recognition as
a tool to foster trade where important
public interests are not at stake.
In the Cassis case,
no such interests were at stake, and
the principle of mutual recognition
was therefore applicable.
This principle implies that
the product lawfully sold in
one national market shall,
as a presumption, also be
lawfully sold at all other national
markets within the internal market.
This means that discrimination
does not have to be demonstrated.
The problem is simply the difference
between national rules.
And these differences can thus be
solved through the application of
the principle of mutual recognition.
The Court didn't however, make the
principle of mutual recognition absolute.
It is only a presumption, and
can therefore be changed if the member
states can show that the difference
between national rules should be
upheld due to mandatory requirement.
Such as consumer or
environmental protection.
In order not to give a carte blanch to
discrimination, the Court made clear that
this balancing test is only applicable
on indistinctly applicable rules.
That is to say, rules that treat
foreign and domestic products alike.
Even more important,
the Court also stressed that
international measures that
are non discriminatory and
based on a mandatory requirement,
must be proportionate to the aim in view.
If a member state has a choice
between various measures,
it should choose the means that least
restrict the free movement of goods.
This is an expression of
the principle of proportionality.
This case law from the Court
of Justice means that
other justification grounds
than those in Article 36,
can be used to justify a measure if
the conditions mentioned are fulfilled.
The Court has against this
background developed a long list of
mandatory requirements which can
potentially justify a trade restriction.
So far so good.
There is however another development in
the case law which
complicates this picture.
The judgement in Cassis and Dasonville,
led to other cases testing the limits of
the principles developed by the Court.
Most well known is the challenging
of the rules on Sunday trading in
the United Kingdom.
If shops could open on Sundays
they could sell more goods.
And some of those goods would be
imported from other member States.
The restrictions on Sunday trading thus
affected trade between the member states.
The Court found that these measures were
justified by legitimate social goals.
But the loaded question was
if such rules should have
to be tested at all by
the court in Luxemburg.
Confronted with these cases,
the Court found a way to
draw a new demarcation line
regarding the scope of Article 34.
These have been in the Keck case.
This case was about the French rule,
that prohibited sale of goods at a price
lower than their actual purchase price.
The Court found that such a rule did not
have the purpose to regulate trade in
goods within member states.
The Court described this rule as
a certain selling arrangement,
which was outside the scope of Article 34.
Provided that it is applied to all
affected traders operating within
the national territory, and then, and
effect in the same manner, in law and
fact, the marketing of domestic products
and those from other member states.
This was the case with the French rule.
And there was therefore no need
to justify it on the basis of
a mandatory requirement.
And it was not necessary to show that
it was proportionate to its aim.
In later case law, the Court has further
defined what kind of measures that
constitute certain selling arrangement and
has taken a rather restrictive approach.
For example,
rules regarding the use of a product,
have not been considered as rules
relating to selling arrangement.
This brings us to the end of this section.
I hope it has made you interested
in the area of free movement and
internal market law.
More lectures will follow.
Thank you for your attention.
