Hello, and welcome to this,
the first in a series of lectures on the
law of competition in the European Union.
My name is Justin Pierce and with Bjorn
Lundqvist, this short course will cover
the main rules and procedures relating
to European Union competition law.
But let's start by asking
two fundamental questions.
Firstly, what is competition?
And secondly,
why is it that we need to protect it?
Well, the simple answer is that
free competition is a key element
of an open market economy.
In a European context, it stimulates
European economic performance, and
offers consumers, like you, and me,
a broader choice, better quality products,
services, and of course,
all at more competitive prices.
So, an objective of
European Union competition policy,
is to ensure competition is not distorted
in the internal market by ensuring that
similar rules apply,
to all the companies operating within it.
Some firms, of course, attempt to distort
this idea of free competition and
adopt anti-competitive behavior in
order to impose their own rules.
For example, firms carrying out similar
activities may come to arrangements with
each other, to control prices.
How much, will they charge you and
me, the consumer?
Will they fix their prices?
Will they divide up the market
amongst themselves, to ensure
maximum profits market share?
Of course what I'm speaking
about here are the most commonly
known anti-competitor practices,
mainly cartels.
Here we see the price fixings,
the dividing of markets,
the carrying out of other
potentially harmful behaviour.
Of course in other instances
where it's just a single firm.
That firm might hold a dominate position
in the market, and may be able to
really use that dominance, in a way that
excludes competitors from the market.
Meaning that they're free to
charge whatever prices they want.
They are not regulated
by other competitors.
This is not good for you, though, for
the consumer or the European Union.
As a result of this, the EU has put in
place, regulations to both prosecute
firms and also prevent them from engaging
in this type of anti-competitive behavior.
And in addition to this we see
a lull in merges and acquisitions.
This is where one firm,
of course, merges with another or
acquires a competitor or
a complimentary market.
But this could also mean, the creation or
the strengthening of a dominant
actor in the market.
And therefore, we control this
idea of merging and acquisition.
And you'll look at this later in
the series when Bjorn speaks to
you about the idea of concentrations
with the European Union dimension.
I've spoken a lot about market,
effecting the market and
anti-competitive behavior, on the market.
But what exactly is it that I mean by
market, because in competition law
we have a very specific meaning for
market.
Because our analysis of whether
ir not a particular behavior or
agreement is anti-competitive, depends
on its potential effect on the market.
In competition analysis,
we therefore focus on
the question of whether or
not companies are, or will be in
a position to exercise market power.
We just can't do this without
reference to a market.
The effects of the actions and
agreements at issue,
can only be expected to have
an impact on any relevant market if
the company's concerned
possess some market power.
So the market becomes the crucial, the
critical aspect, and one typically needs
to proceed to an analysis of what we
mean by market in a particular case.
because the objective of defining
a market, is to identify both,
the product market and the geographic
dimension of where those products
are capable of constraining the commercial
behavior of the company concern.
It therefore provides us a context within
which to assess the competition issues,
via the competitive impact of
a given agreement, a certain type of
conduct by a single company or
indeed a merger or an acquisition.
This concept of market is key to all
our analysis underlying competition.
Companies generally will try
to do this in a very broad way
to illustrate that their effect
on the market is minimal.
They have very little market power.
Perhaps, they might say that they
are only limited geographically,
to very watered down power.
But as we'll see in the later lectures
an as runs through competition law.
Agreeing the definition of
the relevant market, becomes central
to understanding whether or not potential
behavior does indeed distort or
potentially distort,
competition on the market.
We'll do this by looking at
some particular concepts.
Is there substitutability of a product?
Can a consumer simply buy another product?
How narrow is the market on
which a company operates?
The narrower the market,
the greater the market share.
The greater the market share,
the greater the ability of a company or
an association of companies, to abuse or
distort competition on those markets.
There are a number of other,
really specific, analysis that we
use in relation to competition rule.
And in the next presentation, the Bjorn
will take you through the underlying
rationale of these competition principles
and the general operation of them.
You'll of course need to know these,
if you're to engage fully with
the lectures that follow this.
That's all I have for today, and
I shall be back later in the series
to consider more detailed elements of
competition with you.
