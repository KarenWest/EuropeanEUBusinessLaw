Hello Sanja Bogojevic.
>> Hey Here we are in
the Lund law faculty library.
And we're going to talk about
your contribution to the MOOC and
in order to do that, we need to
talk a little bit about yourself.
>> Okay.
>> Who are you.
So, I am a lecturer here.
I'm an Associate Professor in Law and
focusing on Environmental Law.
>> Mm-hm.
>> I'm also the Co-Director of
the Master's program in business,
European Business Law.
And I've worked a little since 2011.
>> Mm-hm.
>> Before that I was.
10 years I studied abroad or
outside of Sweden.
>> Mm-hm.
>> So
I did my doctoral studies at Oxford
University, at Corpus Christi College.
And before that, I was at King's College
in London and also at it was located in,
in Germany and College of, of,
of Europe in Bruge Belgium.
And finally came back to Sweden,
where I was also brought up and born.
>> You were born in Sweden.
>> Yes.
>> You have a very
international background.
But you are a Swede [INAUDIBLE]
>> Exactly.
I come from Malmoe.
I was born in Malmoe.
>> Okay.
What are you normally
teaching here at the faculty?
I teach E law and various strands of
E law focusing on environmental law
in various forms for both at the Masters
program and at the undergraduate level.
And also E law and and another course
at the Masters program which is
called argumentation and methodology.
>> Okay.
>> I'm very proud of those courses in
particular because we were awarded Jean
Monet modules, by the European Commission.
So, they award of those modules due
to our innovation in teaching EU Law.
>> Perfect.
Have you been teaching abroad as well?
>> Yes,
I taught when when I was at Oxford.
>> Yes.
>> I taught also EU Law and
Environmental Law.
>> Is there a difference teaching
in Oxford and teaching in Lund?
>> There are slight differences.
But it's equally rewarding I would say.
>> Yes.
But it, it, different teaching methods?
>> Slightly different teaching
methods in the sense that at
Oxford you have tutorials.
>> Mm-hm.
>> So you also have sem, so
called seminars with two students.
>> Yes.
>> At the time.
But it, also here at Heirloom,
we try to keep or to provide seminars and
house phone groups.
>> Mm-hm.
Mm.
What about your own research?
What was your dissertation about?
>> I wrote about emission trading schemes.
So it's.
>> Hang on.
Emission trading schemes.
>> Emission trading schemes.
>> Okay.
>> So, they are also called carbon markets
and they were, for
the idea of a carbon markets
originates in the US but
it took form in the EU from a directive
that was adopted in 2003 and
then enforced in 2005.
>> So when did you present
your doctorate dissertation.
>> 2000.
2011.
>> 2011.
>> The same year I came here.
>> Okay.
Have you been able to do
other research as well?
>> Yes, so I have continued working
both on climate change law,
EU climate change law, and
also looking at spending on environmental
matters before the EU courts.
And also looked at more generally
property based regulations.
So when you regulate the environment by
creating property rights in environments.
So.
>> Published internationally?
>> Yes.
>> Yes, SSRN perhaps.
>> Exactly.
>> Very good.
And what are you currently working with?
>> So currently I'm working on my
second manuscript which will look at
the adjudication of rights
in natural resources.
So I'll look at or I'm looking at
markets in fishery rights, water markets
emission trading schemes still and, and
markets in or rights created by diversity.
And look at how the court gives
meaning to these rights when
these rights are adjucated,
adjudicated before the EU Courts.
>> And now you have assembled
all your knowledge into this
course segment in our MOOC.
>> Exactly.
>> So what is it you're
covering in your segment.
>> So my lecturing in the MOOC
will address the question why is
environmental law relevant for
the study of European business law.
And I will go through and
explain how what environmental law is
in fact, and how it overlaps inter-react
interacts with the internal market.
So both as a barrier to
the internal market, but
also as a way of building and and,
and broadening the internal market.
>> From a student perspective,
what should the student expect
the learning outcome to be.
And are you, are you going to be
a full-fledged specialist after starting
this, or how would you describe, what,
what's the right level of expectation?
>> The expectation following the,
the my course.
I hope that the students will
get a greater understanding for
the relevance of environmental law, but
also the complexity of environmental law.
>> Mm.
>> And to entice them in to continue
studying Environmental Law and getting a,
a, a broader understanding for
its, its role in an ever-increasing
integrated market.
>> Mm-hm.
How about Environmental Law in today's
fairly chaotic European collaboration?
Is, is Environmental Law affected
by the present turbulence?
>> I very much think so.
Not only the, in, in the EU,
but internationally.
I think with evermore
limited natural resources,
we're pressed to think about Environmental
Law and how we protect the environment.
And also with the economic crisis, we're
forced to think about it in innovative and
creative ways of protecting
the environment.
But doing that in such a way that will
also enhance economic competitiveness.
so, and I think those are the questions
that my course will discuss,
to look into that.
>> So, this is a kind of start up for
what follows once you go into
the Master program in London?
>> Exactly.
Very much so.
>> Where you deepen that type of.
>> Yes.
>> We look forward to looking
at what you have produced.
Thank you very much, Sonja.
>> Thank you.
Thank you, [INAUDIBLE].
