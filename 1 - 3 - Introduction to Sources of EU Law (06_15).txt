Welcome to this lecture.
I'm going to give you an introduction
to the EU law sources.
We will look at the most important
publications and also where to
find the main online resources and
databases available for free.
The link that I'm going to talk about
you will find in the reference material.
Most of the EU publications
are available for free online today.
The official journal
of the European Union,
OJ, is the official compendium
of EU legislation and
other official documents of the EU
institutions, bodies and agencies.
It is published everyday from Tuesday to
Saturday in the official languages of EU
and is available in different formats.
The L series contains mainly secondary
legislation such as regulations,
directives, decisions,
and recommendations.
When you refer to the journal,
you write in a certain way.
Looking at an example,
you see the abbreviation OJ followed
by series, numbers, date and pages.
You can find out more about
how to write a cite in
the Interinstitutional style guide
published in the publication office.
This C series contains information from
the main institutions like notices,
guidelines, announcements, resolutions,
opinions, joint declarations,
preparatory acts and
summaries of judgments.
A reference look the same.
This is a notice from the commission
about definition relevant to market.
The cases are published in
European Court Reports, abbreviated ECR.
This is the official version of the cases.
The report was published
in print until 2012.
After that the report is only
published in a digital version.
The official name is report of cases
before the Court of Justice and
the General Court, which contains
judgment from the Court of Justice,
General Court and Civil service Tribunal.
It is also contains opinions and orders.
For a long time is has been recommended to
refer to a case by giving the reference to
the report of cases like this.
Since 2014, the recommendation is to
refer to a case with a combination of
the usual name of the case, the number
in the register case number, and
the number and a paragraph.
All documents are easy to find in
the legal database of EU, EUR-Lex.
It is a database free online,
available in all official languages.
The database is updated everyday.
In EUR-Lex you'll find Official Journal.
Note that since the 1st of July, 2013,
the electronic edition of the EUR official
journal in EUR-Lex is the authentic one.
EU, including consolidated legislation,
preparatory acts and
legislative history,
EU case law, ECR in PDF,
from 1970 into national agreements and
other official documents.
EUR-Lex entrance page gives you access
to search by document number here,
or quick search box, which is often
enough to be able to find what you need.
If necessary,
you can get much more options.
This could be useful when
you get too many results.
More possibilities to limit your
search and be more specific.
The latest news are published everyday.
Doing a search, you will receive
the result in the middle of the page.
There are often quite of lot of matches.
The refined search query is helpful.
You can find domain, subdomain, year,
type of procedure, author, or type of act.
Another database that is useful,
you find on the webpage of the Court
of Justice of the European Union.
It is available for
free in every official language.
It contains the case from the Court
of Justice, the General court, and
the Civil service Tribunal.
Opinions from the Advocate General,
notes from the Academic Writings,
and press releases about new cases.
On the entrance page of the database,
you find the search fields for
case number, parties, and dates.
There is also an option
to use advanced search,
which you will find behind the button.
The press releases are over here.
Finally, there is a huge
website of the European Union,
where you can find very
many relevant documents.
The European Union has a tradition of
publishing nearly everything online.
The website is translated
into every official language.
All the institutions
have their own homepages.
Those are mainly in English,
German, or French.
One important part of the Europa
website is the news room.
In the press release database
you can search for news and
some commission decision and
you will find in this database.
The database is in our link list.
All the news has a number
which look in a certain way.
If you have a reference
that looks like this,
it is a press release from the commission.
Another way of entering
the webpages is to enter by topic.
This is a way to find information from all
EU institutions within a specific topic.
Go, for example, to the single market,
and look at the commission webpage.
It's an important webpage with
a lot of relevant information.
Searching the webpage is both
time consuming and confusing.
Many times the pages are changed and
the structure is not
always easy to understand.
It could be much more useful
to use a search engine.
Like for example, Bing,
Google, or Safari, and
write the site you want to search,
and then words describing your search.
I suggest you try any of those examples.
Thanks for your attention and
good luck with your searches.
