We will start this section
on fundamental principles by
talking about those principles
that determine what the EU can do.
What competences it has.
The principles that are key here
are the principle of conferred powers,
the principle of subsidiarity and
the principle of proportionality.
I will deal with the first two
principles in this lecture.
There will be a separate lecture on
the principle of proportionality.
The principle of conferred powers
is set out in Article 5 TEU.
Under this principle the EU can
only act where the member states,
through the treaties,
confer a power on it to act.
And then only in order to achieve one
of the objectives which the member
states specified in the treaties.
The EU has no competence which is
independent of that conferred on it
by the member states.
The treaties confer three different
categories of competences.
In some areas such as for
example, the customs union
the EU has exclusive competence.
This means that in these areas
only the EU can legislate and
member states have absolutely no
competence to introduce their own laws.
In other areas such as culture or tourism
the Union has supporting competence.
Here the Union cannot legislate
to harmonize the laws of
the member states but is can act in
order to support, coordinate, or
compliment the actions
of the member states.
But in many of the areas
that are relevant for
the topics covered in this course such
as the internal market, the environment,
consumer protection and social policy,
the union has shared competence.
Shared does not mean that the union and
the member states may both legislate
to regulate a particular area.
It means that the member states have
competence to legislate to the extent that
the union has not
exercised its competence.
As soon as the union exercises
its competences and legislates to
regulate a particular area the member
states no longer have competence to do so.
Any competences not conferred on
the Union by the treaties remain with
the member states.
While this may seem clear-cut, we need
to remember that the treaties set out
the competences of the EU in
very broad and general terms.
The best example of this
is Article 114 TFEU.
This gives the Union the power
to adopt measures for
the approximation of laws which have,
as their object, the establishment and
functioning of the internal market.
This has been interpreted by the court
as meaning that any measures that is
genuinely intended to remove any actual or
even
potential obstacles to the internal market
can fall within the competence of the EU.
Let's give a concrete example.
The EU introduced a measure
that prohibited the sale of
oral tobacco products
such as Swedish Snus.
A manufacturer of Snus
challenged the legality of this
measure on the grounds that the treaty
did not confer on the Union a power to
legislate in order to
protect public health.
The European Court of Justice held that
the objective of this measure was not
public health but the establishment and
function of the internal market.
How can a prohibition on the sale of
a product be considered a measure which
has its object, the establishment and
functioning of the market?
If you prohibit the sale of a product
there will be no market at all.
The answer that the court gave is that
banning the use of one particular product
across the Union was necessary to ensure
the functioning of the internal market for
tobacco products in general.
The courts saw there were already some
countries that had introduced national
laws regulating the sale of Snus and
others considering such measures.
This would lead to differences
between national tobacco markets.
And such differences could pro,
potentially create barriers
in the internal market.
So, to remove the risk of such barriers it
was necessary to introduce common rules.
Of course, in introducing common
rules the Union had two options.
It could introduce common rules that
deregulated the sale of tobacco products.
Or it could introduce rules that regulated
tobacco products quite strictly.
Given that one of the objectives of the
Union is the promotion of a high level of
public health,
then it made sense to choose the option
that would achieve that objective.
So here we are.
The EU did not have the competence
to legislate in order to
protect public health.
However, because it has the competence
to legislate in order to
ensure the functioning of the internal
market, it could introduce measures
to harmonize national laws,
which in effect, protected public health.
And this type of reasoning has
been used to justify many of
the most controversial
measures introduced by the EU.
So, the principle of conferral, while it
may appear to grant the Union a very clear
delineated set of competence, is in fact
a very open ended and ambiguous principle.
This is where some argue that the
principle of subsidiarity can play a role.
The principle of sub, subsidiarity
provides that the Union cannot act
where the objectives of that action can
be better achieved by the member states.
So, if the Union is planning to introduce
a particular regulation or a directive,
it should ask itself, does this measure
need to be taken at a Union level?
Or could the member states achieve
these objectives just as well?
Note that the presumption is that it
should be done by the member states,
unless there are reasons why it
needs to be done by the Union.
So, let's apply this principle to
the Snus case that we discussed.
Who should take this action to
regulate the sale of this product?
The Union, or the member states?
This depends on what we define
as the objective of the measure.
If the objective is defined as protecting
public health, then perhaps the member
state is just as well placed as
the Union to achieve this objective.
If on the other hand, we define the
objective as facilitating the functioning
of the internal market,
then this can only be done at Union level,
because it entails harmonizing
the laws of all the member states.
And by definition,
only the Union can do that.
So, individuals and member states who
want to challenge a Union measure
on the grounds that it breaches
the principle of conferral or
the principle of subsidiarity,
almost never succeed.
The formal legal powers that the Union
has under the treaties are very wide and
allow it, in principle, to regulate almost
any aspect of the member states' laws.
But of course, just because the Union has
the legal power to do a particular act,
does not mean that it should, or
that politically it could do it.
And more importantly, from the perspective
of this course, the principle of
conferral and subsidiarity only
deal with what the Union can do.
Not with how it should it.
This is where the principles
of proportionality,
non-discrimination, legality and
respect for fundamental rights come in.
And they will be the subject
of the next lectures
