Welcome to this lecture
on the effects of EU law.
In the previous lecture Eduardo told
you about what competences the EU has.
Essentially looking at
the question what can the EU do.
As a title this lecture suggests I
will focus on the effects of EU law.
That is what happens when the EU does act,
when the EU does use its competences?
However, before we can
take a closer look at
the actual mechanisms that
give effect to EU law,
I want to make sure that we're on
the same page about what EU law even is.
EU law can be viewed as something
distinct from national law.
A different legal order which can
interact with the national one.
Just as the national legal order
contains a hierarchy of norms, with, for
example, a constitution, laws,
administrative decisions,
et cetera, the EU legal order also
contains different legal instruments.
In terms of EU law, one often speaks
of primary law and secondary law.
Primary law, has a higher normative
value and consists of the treaties.
You might of heard of the TEU,
the Treaty on European Union.
And the TFEU, the Treaty on
the Functioning of European Union.
The EU defender rights which
Magnus will talk to you
about in your next lecture also forms
part of what we can call primary law.
Primary EU law, essentially,
comes about through agreements
between sovereign member states.
Secondary law,
on the other hand, is produced by
the EU institutions themselves.
It's worth mentioning here that
the main institutions in this
regard are the Council, The European
Parliament, and the Commission.
In general terms,
secondary law does produce,
can take the form of a regulation,
a directive, or a decision.
Now that we have a better idea
of what EU law is, now we
can ask ourselves what
difference does it make?
What are the mechanisms
that makes EU law relevant?
Relevant to you, relevant to me,
to the company you're advising, or
to the member state that this company
would like to provide services in.
What makes EU law matter to us?
Well, the three simple answers to
this are direct applicability,
direct effect and primacy.
I will now do my best to briefly
explain these three key concepts.
In turn.
And I would advise you to listen carefully
as you can be sure that there will be
a quiz question on how these
concepts function and interact.
In relation to direct
applicability of EU law,
the first thing I would like you to do is
to take a good look at article 288 TFEU.
As you can see,
all three forms of secondary law that
I mentioned earlier are binding.
Even if directives are only
binding as the result.
However, it is only regulations that
are said to be directly applicable.
Well, what does this mean,
that regulations are directly applicable?
The insistence on direct
applicability can be
explained by the traditional view of EU
law as being part of international law.
And hence, something very
different from national law.
Traditionally, the question of whether
international law becomes applicable law
within the legal order of sovereign state
is a question left to the state at hand.
That is it is up to each
state to decide if and
how international law should
apply in their territory.
Following this logic,
it would have been up to the member
state to decide when EU law should
overlap with national law, and be
applicable with in the national context.
It should be noted,
that states have traditionally treated
international law in very different ways.
Some states, embracing international law
as directly applicable on their territory,
and some states requiring all
international law to first be
transposed into national law
before it can be applicable.
Therefore, it was very important for
the founders of the EU to set out
that some EU law would actually
be directly applicable.
Hence, it flows from EU primary
law that regulations need not, and
indeed should not,
be transposed into national law.
They are, by their very nature,
directly applicable in the member states.
From what was said about
direct applicability.
You might now have the impression
that regulations are the only form of
EU law that really matters
in a national context.
Well, early on in the history of
the European union it's Court of Justice,
most commonly known as ECJ,
established that a much wider range of
EU law was destined to have direct
legal effects in the member states.
In the classic judgement of Van Gend en
Loos, which you can find in the resources
connected to this lecture, the ECJ
introduced for the very first time, and
without any clear legal basis in the
treaties, the principle of direct effect.
Together with primacy, this principle
has become the very foundation for
giving concrete effects to EU
law in the national context.
In fact, as far as definitions go,
direct effect can be
defined as the capacity of EU
law to give rise to rights and
obligations directly, without the need for
further implementation.
In practical terms, it means that
you should be able to invoke and
enforce provisions of EU law with
direct effect in your national context.
Whether it be before a Spanish court or
a Swedish administrative body in
a contract dispute or
as a defense against criminal prosecution.
This definition before you might
sound like direct applicability.
But direct applicability is not in
itself a prerequisite for direct effect.
A particular provision of EU law can
be deemed to produce direct effect even
though the legal instruments where we
find the provision is not a regulation.
Instead of connecting direct effect to
direct applicability the ECJ chose to
expound three concrete conditions
that all have to be fulfilled for
a specific EU provision
to have direct effect.
Firstly, the provision has to be clear and
precise.
There should be no ambiguity about what
EU law in question actually requires.
Secondly, the provision has to contain
an unconditional right to obligation.
If the first condition is concerned
with the clarity of language,
the second condition is concerned with
clarity of the right to obligation itself.
Thirdly and lastly, the provision should
not be dependent on implementing measures.
This last condition would seem to exclude
the possibility of provisions and
directives ever producing direct effect.
Granted.
Directives are a bit particular
when it comes to direct effect.
Since they are addressed to
the member states, and only the end,
not the means, are said to be binding,
the ECJ has consistently held that
directives can not produce direct effect,
at least not between private parties.
To this effect it is often stated that
there can be no horizontal direct
effect flowing from directives.
However, when it comes to
relationships between the state, and
a private party, directives can
produce vertical direct effect.
At least when the EU provision is invoked
by the private party as against the state.
The ECJ has ruled that the member state,
and thereby any public administration or
undertaking should be precluded
from benefiting from the fact that
a member state itself has neglected
to implement a directive correctly.
This kind of reasoning stems from
the so-called Estoppel principle,
which prescribes that no one should be
able to benefit from their own misconduct.
As I stated earlier, direct effect and
primacy works together to
ensure an effective EU law.
Shortly after the introduction of
direct effect in Vend Gend en Loos,
the ECJ went on to introduce
the principle of primacy of the EU law.
In its Costa versus Enel judgment,
which you'll also find in the resources.
This principle basically requires that
EU law has a higher normative value and
that it has to be given effect, even in
the presence of a contrary national norm.
I would like you to think
about what this means and
try to answer the following question.
So, as you see, the combination of
direct effect on the one hand and
primacy on the other can be quite
a force to be reckoned with.
However, as a very li,
last note on primacy I would like to add
that even if the EU provision at hand, for
one reason or another, does not fulfill
the criteria for having direct effect.
Primacy can still come into play.
The primacy of EU law gives rise to an
obligation of EU conform interpretation.
Which was most known to be laid down
in the ECJ Marleasing judgement.
This obligation implies that
all national rules must be
interpreted in light of EU law.
And should as far as possible,
be given an interpretation which
is in conformity with EU law.
And here I mean all EU law.
Not just the one which has direct effect.
I'll let those be my final words for
this session, I hope it has been
helpful and thank you for your time.
