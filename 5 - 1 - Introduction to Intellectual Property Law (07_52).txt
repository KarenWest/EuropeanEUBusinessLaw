During this course, on, European
Intellectual Property Law, you will become
familiar with some of the predominant
types of intellectual property.
>> We will address European Trademark Law,
European Design Law,
European Patent Law,
European Copyright Law, and finally we
will discuss Intellectual Property Law
in an Information Technology context.
Areas that can be developed
further in separate lectures.
>> A starting point however,
will be provided by this lecture.
During which we will tackle some
general aspects related to,
to Intellectual Property Law.
IP law is multi-faceted, and possesses
a number of unique characteristics.
For example,
while most law may generally be regarded,
as strictly national matter, Intellectual
Property Law is harmonized area of law.
Globally to some extent, and regionally
within the EU to met, much larger degree.
IP law started out as
an international movement and
early international initiatives or
the starting point for
the legal development, often
a contributing factor to national laws.
IP law can also be said to be in
technological oriented area of law.
This is obvious in relations
to inventions and designs.
But it's also clearly visible in
relations to copyright as an area of
law that covers creations like
computer games and software.
Furthermore, IP law is
quite often an issue in
relations to information technology.
Thirdly, and
perhaps obviously, intellectual
property rights are extremely valuable.
Much of today's most important business
assets are located in IP rights.
Simultaneously, IP rights
intersect with other
important areas of law,
like freedom of speech and
access to information,
making room for counter arguments.
The fact that human right is
relevant in relations to IP
right was manifested already in
the Universal Declaration of human rights.
Which was adopted by the UN General
Assembly on the tenth of December, 1948.
Another example showing the relevance to
view IP right in a human right context
is the inclusion of IP rights as
fundamental rights in the EU Charter
of Fundamental Rights of
the European Union, article 72.
Issues as to privacy and
access to knowledge, become relevant
in relations to file sharing,
in copyright protection, as one example.
Another example, where human rights
may conflict with IP rights,
not particularly related to IT,
is access to health.
And patent protection for
innovations in the pharmaceutical sector.
Having considered that protection
of IP rights is
a controversial area of law,
it maybe questions, why there is
a protection in the first place?
How can we justify this
complex system of rules?
As will be developed further
during the lectures to come.
The IP system is based on that idea that
the different interests that
relate to IP can be balanced.
IP rights are, as a consequence,
not absolute but
the rights surrendered by exceptions and
limitations.
One common argument that
justifies protection is that IP
rights create incentive for
innovators and artist.
And that such incentives leads to more
innovation and a more vibrant culture.
This, in turn,
is beneficial for the society.
Another justification for
protection related to moral and
ethical consideration is that it is
fair that someone that creates also
should be rewarded for that work.
IP rights provide possibilities for
remuneration as to
trademarks, it should be added that
arguments regard an incentive and
rewards provides no justification.
A justification for a trademark protection
is rather that these rights are needed to
uphold a functional market and
fair and effective competition.
Without proprietal rights in relations
to trademarks, as market on the free
competition would
soon become a Celtic Anarchy
flowed with pirated goods.
In all areas of IP law,
there is a fundamental understanding
that protection needs to be balanced
in relation to other interests.
The balance is upheld by means of
exceptions and limitations and
one additional crucial skill is
therefore to be aware of exceptions and
limitations that are applied
in that different areas.
>> And finally, all areas which
may sound strange may be defined,
as negative rights.
Meaning that IT protection provides
the proprietor with the right to
prevent others from using
the protected property.
A consequence of that would be that
there is a embedded need to act if you
want the protection to be effective, and
with that follows a need to be aware of
different instruments, as to enforcements.
>> During this course we will not be
able to highlight all aspects of IP law.
We'll focus on the scope of protection and
how it relates to exceptions and
limitations.
But we will only briefly address issues
as to the enforcement of IP rights.
>> In general terms, the work with
IP law may be described as two-fold.
First, there are the obvious cases,
as may be illustrated by the fact
that the propriety's entitled to
prevent someone else from
copying protected property.
>> The elusive and
problematic second part, however,
is to access not so obvious situations.
For example, uses the similar but
not directly copying to
the protected property.
>> And this is a field for
skillful lawyers and
complicated infringement disputes.
It is quite common that lawyers have
to collaborate with external experts in
order to asses whether or
not a creation may be protected, or not if
someone else's use of a similar product
do reach the level of similarity that
suffices for an infringement to occur.
We also hope that you will
find IP law as exciting and
interesting as we do, and, consequently,
that you will be motivated to conduct
further studies in this area of law.
