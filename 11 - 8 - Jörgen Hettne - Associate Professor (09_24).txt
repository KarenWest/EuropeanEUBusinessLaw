Jorgen Hettne?
>> Mm-hm.
Yes.
>> What a pleasure to have you here in
facility room.
In what is a very nice day.
>> Thank you very much.
>> Your welcome.
We're going to talk about you, and
we're going to talk about your
contribution to our MOOC.
And maybe you could introduce
yourself first of all?
>> Yeah.
I'm Jorgen Hettne, and
I'm a associate professor at The Faculty
of Law at Lund University, okay.
And I am also an acting Director for
a research institute,
which is called SIEPS, Swedish
Institute For European Policy Studies.
>> Which is an institute appointed by,
funded by, the government?
>> It's funded by the government.
It's a governmental agency, yes.
Yes.
>> Mm-hm.
You are also active in other
situations on behalf of the government.
>> Yeah, I've been appointed chair of
several inquiries for the government.
When it has been question about union or
application of union or
regarding Swedish legislation.
Third times I've been appointed chair for
that, these kinds of inquiries.
>> Let's talk about your
academic background.
Eh, you produced a dissertation,
which was presented in what year?
>> 2008.
>> 2008.
And it was about.
>> It was about general
principle of EU law.
>> Yes.
>> And it was actually the more
practical application of
the other principles of EU law
in different areas, of the law.
>> Hm.
Since you presented that, in 2008, and
you've been CF's director and you've been
in all these governmental capacities.
Have you been able to perform
research at the same time?
>> Yes, I've been trying hard and
I've produced also some articles and
reports, also books.
But a few books also for, for
students, for, for teaching purposes.
>> Book one is about legal method.
>> Yeah, one is about legal method,
that's right.
>> Have you articles which
are published internationally?
>> Yeah,
been publishing about stated law and
peripheral human law, also international.
>> Okay.
And, what about at present?
You're still a director at SIEPS?
>> Yeah.
I'm still there, now.
>> Are you performing any research,
at the moment, as well?
>> I'm, now, I'm studying
the principle of subsidiarity.
And, especially, early warning system for
national parliaments.
Which is subsidiary tests done by
the Europe national parliaments and
the European Union before a proposal.
When a proposal is proposed
by the commission.
So that system is under my resort for
the moment.
And it's going to be a book,
or an article?
>> It's, it will be a book chapter.
>> Mm-hm.
>> Together with other researchers.
>> Mm.
>> In the beginning of next year,
is the plan.
>> Hm, mm-hm.
>> So SIEPS director, stellar researcher.
Are you able to perform
any education activities?
>> Yeah.
I think it's important to be,
still be in contact with
the university and the students.
I'm teaching at Lund University,
at this faculty and so
that I'm doing every year still.
>> What kind of courses?
>> Well I'm mostly involved
in the master program.
So it's about the Internal Market Law.
Which is a compulsory
course in the beginning.
And then I had also a more deeping
internal market course about
new challenges of internal markets.
And also one about more stated and
public procurement called stated
measures distorting competition,
which is later in the master program.
>> You were actually covering
both constitutional aspects and
substance aspects, eh, in your education.
>> Yeah, that's right, and
I think they're very mixed
>> Hm.
>> Nowadays in EU law constitution aspect,
and material aspects.
>> Maybe it's not so common that people
are as broad in their approach as you are.
And that people are often specialized
in one a little area or another.
But you cover it, European law.
>> Yeah.
>> Wider sense.
>> Yes, I think so.
But maybe reason for that is whereas I
start as practitioner in the year when
I worked at the General Court for
over six years as a legal secretary.
>> Mm-hm.
>> And then you have quite a broad
understanding when you start.
>> Mm-hm.
And then it's too many things
which are interesting and
they, it's difficult to specialize.
>> How does this come out in the MOOC,
now?
If a what's your contribution to the MOOC?
>> similar.
It is spread out.
I have one one lecture
about illegal method-
>> Mm-hm.
>> And sources.
And then one about free moment a goats.
And a third one about stated law.
>> Mm-hm.
So, you, it actually shows in
your MOOC education, as well,
that you're involved in
several different areas?
>> Yeah.
That's right.
>> Mm-hm.
What should the students expect,
after having studied
your, your contribution to
the constitution of this section.
What should they expect as
a learning outcome from that class?
>> I think that is very introductory,
so I, I try to give them some
general understanding how these legal
systems differ from natural legal systems.
So they get the right start so to speak.
>> Are you covering
subsidiarity in that class?
>> We not talk about subsidiarity
during this and during the MOOC.
There will be others talking about
that during the constitution course.
But, I still like to go
back to subsidiarity in,
in terminating our discussion now.
You are presently interested in
the subsidiarity in your research.
And to what extent, what,
what is subsidiarity?
Can you summarize that in, very briefly?
>> Yeah, it's to decide,
actually what the union should do and
what should still be something for
the member state.
So, it's a kind of division of power.
>> Because that leads to
the question I like to ask you.
And that is,
to what extent is the present Euro
crisis having an impact
on Constitutional issues?
And subsidiarity is a good one.
Is there an impact from the Euro crisis?
>> I think it's a general problem with
kind of democratic deficit in the union.
And some National Parliaments is
asking to have more power in a way,
more influence,
when the union is, is acting.
And proposing legislation.
So there is a voice that the National
Parliament should have more influence.
>> Mm hm.
>> But that is quite difficult issue
from a constitutional perspective,
because that would change
the constitution of balance submits, so.
It's actually that question I'm,
I'm looking at.
If it's possible to give the national
Parliaments more power or
not, in this control.
>> It has always been said,
that the European collaboration
is developing out of its crisis.
And if it is a crisis at the moment, then
you would expect more of European Union
power after the crisis ended, has ended.
>> Yeah.
>> Is it.
>> Yeah, I think,
in some areas,
it's quite obvious that it's,
it's going in that direction.
So, the Union is getting more powers,
when it comes to economic policy.
The next step is of course is
you would have some balance, so
we have more powers regarding
social policy, as well.
Well that is a difficult one of them.
Of that we don't know.
But we cannot know for sure.
It's an interesting discussion going on.
>> A good way to get into
this is by starting to
listen to your lecture on constitution.
What was it?
Constitutional or [CROSSTALK].
>> Yeah, EU League and method.
And, and [CROSSTALK].
>> EU League and method.
That's really
>> Yeah.
And to understand also the sources
of union law in general.
If you compare with national law.
They're very different.
>> Thank you very much.
>> Thank you.
