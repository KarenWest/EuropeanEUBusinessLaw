Hello and welcome back.
In this lecture,
we will look at the specific field
in the external dimension of the EU.
I'm going to talk about the EEA agreement.
The EA agreement is unique in
the external relations of the EU.
It extends the internal market and
the rules of competition to three EFTA
states, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.
But the most unique feature is
the judicial structure of the EEA
agreement and the way in which EU
law is incorporated in the EEA
agreement to ensure the unification
of EU law also for the EEA states.
No other international
agreement between the EU and
other third countries goes
as far as the EEA agreement.
We will now look briefly
at the history of the EA,
it's celebrates 20 years
of existence in 2014 and
then look at the specific features
of this unique legal system.
During the 1980s, there were two
free trade organizations in Europe.
The European Economic Community and
the European Free Trade Association or
EFTA for short.
One of the most prominent
members of the EFTA,
the United Kingdom had joined
the European Community already in 1973.
As the EEC showed its strength,
the EFTA states started to voluntarily
adapt their legislation to the directives
and regulation of European community.
As the 1980s drew to a close, the EFDA
states decided that they wish to go
even further, they wanted to be
part of the internal market.
At the same time however,
they did not want the supra
national features of EU law.
They did not want direct effect.
They were reluctant to accept primacy.
In short, they wanted access to
the internal market without the effects of
EU law.
The result of the negotiations
was presented in 1992 as
the Agreement of the European
Economic Area or EEA for short.
After a shaky start, the ECJ rejected
the first draft of the agreement,
it entered into force in 1994.
However, in 1995,
many of the EFTA states left
the EFTA to become members
of the European community.
Since the EEA agreement is a mixed
agreement, all EU member states remain
members to the EEA agreement together
with the three EEA EFTA states.
Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein.
But what is covered by EA agreement?
How is the institutional structure set up?
And finally, how does it work?
The EEA agreement covers
two distinct areas,
all of which have been
covered earlier in this MOOC.
The first is the free movement of workers,
capital, services and
the freedom of establishment.
The second area is the rules of
competition, including State aid Control.
But just like the EU has seen its
competences move beyond this core issues,
the EEA agreement also
covers other issues, but
to a much smaller extent than in the EU.
The EEA agreement also integrates
EU rules on the environment,
such as the reach regulations,
financial regulations and so on.
If a certain field falls outside
the scope of the EEA agreement,
the EU concludes bilateral
agreements with the EEA EFTA states.
Such an example is the bilateral ag,
bilateral agreement between the EU
on one hand and Iceland and
Norway on the other on the mutual
recognition of arrest warrants.
But EU legislation, which could be
said to implement the core rules in
the EEA agreement is incorporated
in the EEA agreement.
Therefore, EEA law contains
exactly the same directives and
regulations as EU law in these fields.
These EU directives and
regulations are continuously placed
in the annexes to the EEA agreements.
Sometimes, they contain minor adjustments
in order to adapt them to the EEA.
Adaptations include everything
from the addition of lists of
competent authorities in the EEA
states to political declarations from
the contracting parties in
constitutional matters.
Therefore, if you ever have
to deal with a EEA agreement,
always look at the relevant
acts to see if there has been
a specific amendment to the act when it
was incorporated in the EEA agreement.
Once these regulations and
directives have been incorporated however,
they have the same effect
in the EEA as in the EU.
Let us now turn to the institutional
structure of the EEA agreement.
The aim of the agreement,
economic integration without
political integration is obvious
when we look at the institutions.
There is no legislative
process in the EEA agreement.
And therefore, there are no
corresponding institutions in the EEA to
the parliament and the council.
Instead, the decisions to incorporate
EU legislation in the EEA
agreement are taken by the EEA joint
committee or the EFTA states and
the EU had one vote each and
decisions are taken by unanimous vote.
The EFTA Surveillance Authority plays
the same role as the commission in the EU.
The role of ESA,
as it is often called is to exercise
the supervision in the EEA EFTA states.
This include State aid control,
competition policy, and
making sure the EEA EFTA states implement
and apply EEA law just like the commission
keeps an eye on the EU member states, but
there are also important differences.
ESA cannot impose a fine for
infringement of EEA law and
since there is no legislative process.
Although, I personally consider
the incorporation process to
be quasi-legislative.
The ESA does not have that
initiative to legislation as
the commission has in the EU.
The EEA Joint Committee and the ESA
are complemented by the EFTA Court.
The EFTA Court ensures
the judicial functions in the EEA.
It works very much like the ECJ in the EU.
It receives requests for interpretation
of EEA law from the courts and
the EEA EFTA states and
it is the appeals court for
decisions from ESA in state aid and
competition.
It also deals with
infringement cases brought by
ESA against the EEA EFTA states.
And how does this work in practice?
Here we have the EEA EFTA states.
They apply EU law, but they have their
own institutions and their own court.
Isn't there risk that EU law and
EEA law may be interpreted differently,
even if the rules are the same?
It is tempting to say that it is easy.
But actually, the EA agreement raises
a number of issues in this regard.
Mostly, they are sold on the principles
of homogeneity and reciprocity.
These two principles are essential for
the good functioning of EEA agreements.
In order to ensure that EU law is
applied in the same way in the EU
member states and the EEA EFTA states,
the EEA agreement contains provisions
concerning the homogeneous application
of EU law under the EEA agreements.
The relevant provision is
found in article six EEA.
I suggest that you take a break and
read this provision carefully.
As you can see from this provision,
the provisions of the EEA agreement in so
far as they are identical in substance to
corresponding rules of the EU treaties and
to act adopted in application
of these two treaties.
That is directives and regulations.
They shall in their implementation and
application be interpreted in
conformity with the relevant rulings
of the ECJ given prior to 1992.
However, this principal also
applies to later case law.
In another agreement,
concluded between the EEA EFTA states
establishing the SA and the EFTA court.
It is stipulated that these
institutions must pay due
account of later developments
in the case law of the ECJ.
The question is how far
reaching this obligation is?
In the EFTA court, the principle
of homogeneity is taken seriously.
In addition to rules in
the EEA agreement itself,
the principle of homogeneity has also
been applied to procedural rules.
This is called Procedural Homogeneity.
Bu the exact scope of
the principle is unclear.
There are examples where
the EFTA Court has let case law of
the ECJ have precedence over
its own previous case law.
Although, it could be discussed
whether the rules applied by
the two courts in those cases
were really identical in
substance as stipulated
in article six EEA.
In another case, the EFTA Court has stated
that homogeneity can only be applied if
the relevant provisions are identical
in substance in the EU and the EEA.
After a decision in the EEA joint
committee that the relevant rule
should indeed be applied in the EEA.
These re the most extreme cases.
But on the whole, the EFTA court and
the ECJ apply the rules in the same way.
The ECJ regularly stresses the fact
that the EEA agreement and
EU law are to be interpreted
in a uniform manner.
Actually, the EFTA Court is one of the few
courts regularly cited by the ECJ.
In fact, there is an ongoing
judicial dialog between the ECJ and
the EFTA Court on
the interpretation of EU law.
This is particularly important
where the EFTA court must go
first due to a lack of existing
jurisprudence from the ECJ.
So to sum up,
the application of EU law and
EEA law is identical if
the rules are identical.
If they are not,
well that must be solved case by case.
The principle of reciprocity in the EEA
is the corollary to homogeneity, but
from the perspective of the individual.
It is the core of the protection of
individual rights in the EEA agreement.
The fourth recital of the EEA
agreement underlines the purpose to
establish a dynamic and homogeneous
legal system based on common rules and
equal conditions of competition and
providing for
the adequate means of enforcement,
including at the judicial level.
This has to be achieved on the basis
of equality and reciprocity and
of an overall balance of benefits, rights
and obligations of contracting parties.
In the jurisprudence of the EFTA Court and
the ECJ,
reciprocity has been extended to mean that
the rights of individuals in the EEA and
the EU must be the same if
the rules are identical.
This is of particular importance in
the exercise of the four freedoms.
There would be an imbalance in benefits
and obligations if the XSAs would not be
identical in the EU and
the EEA EFTA states.
Take more instance mutual recognition or
the right to social benefits.
Both, which may be essential for
a self-employed person moving
within the EEA with his family.
So to sum up, the application of
EU law and EEA law is identical if
the rules are identical and
this must be achieved in such a way that
the rights exercised under EU law
are the same under EU law and EEA law.
There is plenty more to discover
with the EEA agreement.
All EU member states
are members of the EEA,
as well as Iceland,
Norway and Lichtenstein.
The EEA is unique in the external
dimension of the EU business law.
I hope that you have received at least
an idea of how the internal market can be
extended through mixed agreements
between the EU, its member states and
third countries.
This is my last lecture in this MOOC.
It has been a pleasure to participate and
prepare the lectures and
I sincerely hope that you feel
it has been a pleasure too.
So thank you for tuning in and goodbye.
