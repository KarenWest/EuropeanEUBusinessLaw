Bjorn Lundquist, it was a pleasure to
meet you here, in the law library.
On a wonderful summer day, here in Sweden.
And you are a participant
in our MOOC course.
And would you please introduce yourself?
Your academic background.
Say a few words about who you are.
>> Sure.
Thank you, [INAUDIBLE].
Yeah, it's, it's very nice to be here
in the library, at, Lund University.
yes.
I have an academic background.
I, I I'm an associate professor at
Copenhagen Business School, and
I'm a lecturer here at Lund University.
And I both teach and
are very interested in competition law,
in EU law, and
also intellectual property law.
Especially the interface between
these four, these system.
And I hopefully have done some,
some research which will interest people.
>> I'm very interested in your research.
>> Yeah?
>> And I think we all are.
What was your academic dissertation about?
>> My academic dissertation was
about joint warranty agreements.
And also patten pools.
Both from a EU competition law
perspective and and the U.S.
anti trust law perspective.
>> Mm-hm.
>> So did a comparative perspective
between the European system and the,
the US system.
>> So competition law.
Has that been the theme of your,
work afterwards as well?
>> It has, I, I've devoted my,
both my academic life and
my, my practicing life to competition law.
>> Mm-hm.
>> So I, I-
>> And you have a practical background,
right?
>> Yes.
>> Yeah.
>> I do.
>> Say a few words.
>> Few words, yeah [LAUGH].
Now, I, I I practice as an attorney,
mainly Stockholm, but also in Brussels.
Dealing with well,
all kinds of competition law.
so, merger notifications,
article 102 cases, and article 101 cases.
Both of the Swedish competition authority
and, and, and the European commission.
>> So both from an academic and
practical perspective you have
been working with competition law.
>> I have yeah.
>> And what have you done in terms of
research after you became
a doctor of the law.
>> I yeah, I,
I got very interested in one specific
part of the interface between competition
law and intellectual property law.
And, and that was standardization and
standard setting and
standard setting organizational issues.
So I devoted quite
a number of years to that
which I've actually recently
concluded in my book.
>> Which I brought to you here.
[LAUGH]
>> Thank you very much.
Thank you.
>> I hope you get,
yeah you find it interesting.
Have you under published
internationally published, works?
>> I yes.
I try to.
I, I published article 102 and
of course done my case.
Which is big case.
From, from this region, and, and, and
also place into this, article 102.
The new development with possibly
a new test on article 102.
That was published in European
law review for example.
I also published some parcels
regarding R&D collaborations in in,
in books and so on.
And that is a little bit what
I'm turning to now in my
research after doing
the standardization aspects.
>> You have been preparing this course for
quite some time now.
What do you hope is
the learning outcome for
the student who is
following your sections?
>> I yeah, I, I hope they,
my main goal is actually that to get,
interested in competition law.
And understand how important it is
to society and, and to the economy.
and, but all this starts to,
to walk with small steps on the road to,
to much more knowledge.
It is a beginner's course.
That is quite clearly so.
And it's a way to promote
competition a lot.
But also actually to see to that we
get good students coming in to learn.
And wanting to go our master program.
And, yeah,
get a very good discussion here.
>> It's a fairly big field.
Do the students need to study
before they start with your course?
Or can you get straight into it?
>> I think you can get straight into it.
But, I mean of course it's always good to
prepare yourself if you want to, and, and
read some introductory book or
article, and so on and so forth.
But.
>> Normally.
>> That shouldn't stop the students from
just downloading our, our,
our lectures and just have a look at it.
There are small tests,
though, in the lecture.
So you know.
>> Mm.
>> So you know that you need to
actually answer to be able
to move on in the lecture.
So if you can't answer them based
on what I say in the lecture,
then perhaps you should pick up a book and
start reading.
>> We look forward to that.
>> Good, thank you.
>> Thank you very much, Bjorn.
>> Thank you Alexander.
