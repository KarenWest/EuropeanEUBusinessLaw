Hello, and welcome back.
In this series of three lectures,
we will take a look at
the external dimension of the European
Union from a legal perspective.
In the lectures,
we will look at three focus points.
First, we will take a look at the rules in
the EU treaties, which may be irrelevant.
We will also look at
the institutional setup in the EU.
In particular, the role of different
institutions and the EU member states.
In the second lecture,
we will take a look at the competence of
the European Union in the field
of external relations.
That is to say, what are the institutions,
which we look at today, allowed to do?
And what are they not allowed to do?
We will look at the external
dimension of different fields of law,
such as the commercial policy.
Development policy,
the common area of freedom, security and
justice, and the energy market.
Each and every of these fields of
law are of a different character.
And the rules, as a consequence,
are also different.
The third lecture will cover cover a spec,
a special field in EU law, the extension
of the internal market and the rules and
competition to the EFTA states through the
agreement of the European economic area.
But in this first lecture,
we will look at the general setup of
the external dimension of EU law.
We will look at the rules, and
we will look at the institutions.
These are intertwined since the rules
govern the institutional setup.
As with most, if not all fields of EU law,
there is primary law,
the treaties, and secondary law,
directives and regulations.
The law regulates the balance
between the two main players in
the external dimension.
The EU itself on one hand, and
its member states on the other.
It is this parallel setup that
creates the complexity of the system.
This, of course,
implies that both the EU and
its member states has competences in
the field of the external dimension.
This is due to the fact that the European
Union according to article 47 TEU,
is an international organization
with legal personality,
that means that it exists
distinct from its member states.
And as a result, both the EU and
the member states can act,
on the international arena.
Sometimes they act at
once at the same time.
Sometimes they act separately.
Sometimes one of them acts first.
And sometimes they do not act at all.
At the end of the day,
this is a political decision.
And since this course
covers the legal dimension,
I will leave these
considerations aside for now.
But the next time you listen to the news,
you watch tv,
read a news story online, take a minute
to ask yourself who is acting now?
Is it the European Union?
Is it a member state?
And who may be confident to
act in this particular case?
In the external dimension of the European
Union, there are seven main players.
One is
the European External Action Service and
the high representative,
or the EEAS, for short.
You find the legal basis
in Article 27 TEU.
The purpose is to present a strong,
coherent voice,
in fields, outside,
of the common commercial policy.
It is not,
an EU institution which naturally limits
its influence and scope of action.
The European Council, on the other hand,
sets out the future policy-making
of the EU, and as such,
may influence non-legal but
important foreign policy activity.
The Council is another
agenda-setting institution.
The Foreign Affairs Council,
which consists of the Ministers of
Foreign Affairs of the member states,
elaborate the Union's external action on
the basis of strategic guidelines laid
down by the European Council, and
ensure that the Union's
action remains consistent.
The European Commission is
a key player in this field.
Although the dedicated director general
for external relations was removed and
became the EEAS, the external dimension of
most policy areas mean that the commission
has remained a key player in this field.
The fields of trade, energy,
and humanitarian aid were never
transferred to the EAAS and they remain
fully in the hands of the commission.
There commission also represents the EU
abroad, with the exception inter alia for
the common foreign and security policy.
The European Parliament has proven to
be a very active player in the field of
external relations.
The European Parliament is regularly
consulted, it must give its
consent before an international agreement
can be concluded by the European Union.
This was apparent before
the signing of the TTIP with
the United States of America.
The Court of Justice, of course, plays
a pivotal role in the external dimension.
One of its main task is to
decide on the delimitation of
external competences between the union and
its member states.
Its judgements in these matters
are therefore very important for
the institutional balance in the EU.
And then last but not least,
there are the member states.
Despite their membership in the EU,
the member states are still
international actors themselves.
The principle of conferral
means that the EU
can act only as long as there
is a competence to act.
If there is no competence for the EU,
or indeed, if there is a shared competence
between the EU and the member states,
the member states remain free to
act on the international arena.
Now we have a picture of
the actors in this field.
All these play a role in the external
dimension of the EU, but what do they do?
And how do they do it?
And what are they allowed to do?
We will try to answer some of these
questions in the time that remains in
this lecture and
in the lecture that follows this one.
At this point,
we will take a short look at two
important provisions in the treaties.
First, we will take a look
at Article 288 TFEU.
Please take a quick look at the text now.
As you can see, this provision presents
the legal acts which can be adopted by EU,
and their effect.
Old instruments utilized by the EU to
legislate internal policy matters, can and
are being used in the, also in
the context of EU external relations.
These tools are the regulations,
the directives, and the decisions.
These legal acts are generally referred
to as hard law of the EU, but also soft
law recommendations and opinions can
have an impact on EU external relations.
Recommendations and
opinions play an important role.
One example are the conclusions
of the European Council,
which trigger action at all levels
of governance within the EU,
within the member states and
all the EU institutions.
So, now we have looked at the internal
aspects of the external dimension.
But what about the external damage?
How does the EU become an actor
in the international arena?
Or in other words how is the structure
that I described, actually put to use?
With article 216 TFEU we
will move out of the EU, and
look at the basic provision which
opens the possibility for the EU.
To conclude international
agreements with third countries.
Article 216 TFEU sets
up the general competence of EU to
conclude international agreements.
Please note,
that this is the general provision.
In the next lecture,
we will look at the separate fields of law
where this competence may be exercised.
According to Article 216, the EU has a
competence in the following circumstances.
Where the treaties so provide.
Where the conclusion of
an agreement is necessary,
in order to achieve within
the framework of the union's policies.
One of the objects referred
to in the treaties.
When it is provided for
in the legally binding union act, and
when it is likely to affect common rules,
or alter there scope.
The EU is party to well
over one thousand treaties.
Relations with third countries now covers
almost all areas covered by the treaties.
I will not burden you by listing
all the treaty provisions,
according to which the EU has competence
to conclude in international agreement.
Rather, a selection can be found in
the reading materials to this lecture.
We will now conclude this lecture by
looking briefly at the procedure for
the conclusion of new
international agreements.
The procedure is laid
down in article 218 TFEU.
As you can see, the procedure
is in the hands of the council.
Also the commission is the key actor.
The commission initiates
the procedure by a recommendation.
We find this in paragraph three.
But needs the approval of the council.
Paragraph two,
the council then controls the procedure
through directives or consultations.
You see this in paragraph four.
Then the council issues an authorization
to sign according to paragraph five.
According to paragraph six,
the European Parliament must be
consulted in a number of cases.
There are four categories of agreements.
There are mixed agreements which
implies that both the union and
its member states become
parties to the agreement.
There are association, assetion,
and withdrawal agreements involving
reciprocal rights and obligations,
common action, and special procedure.
There is the assetion to
international organizations.
And finally, there are the future
agreements concluded by
the member states only.
The third lecture in this areas will deal
with a special type of mixed agreement,
EEA agreement.
For those of you wanting to read more
about these issues, I recommend the book,
EU external relations law,
by Bart van Vouren and Ramses A Wessel.
That concludes the lecture of today.
The next one is about the specific
fields of law in the context of
the external relations of EU.
Thank you for tuning in and
see you soon again.
