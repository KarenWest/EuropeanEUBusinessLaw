Welcome to this lecture.
This lecture, we are going to look at
different documents from the commission.
Do you know how to find proposals for
new legislation?
Notices or guidelines from the commission,
regarding competition, for
example, in the field of mergers.
Notices and
guidelines play an important part of the
interpretation of the merger regulation.
Implementation reports
regarding legislation, for
example, regarding the implementation
of the services directive, and
directives in the area
of working conditions.
The documents are published
in different ways.
They're proposals for new legislation.
It's published in the COM
documents series,
where official documents from
the Commission are published.
Other important documents like notices,
for
example, are only published
in official journal.
Some documents are only published
at the Commission webpage.
How do you find a COM document?
If we look at a document,
COM (2011) 651, proposal for
a regulation of
the European Parliament and
of the council on insider dealing and
market manipulation, market abuse.
COM is the Commission document symbol for
the official document from the Commission.
2011 is the year the year
the document is published.
And 651 is the number.
And final means that it
is the final version.
The COM documents
are available in EUR-Lex.
You can search for
the document on the entrance page, where
you will fill in year, number and type.
One of the reasons for using EUR-Lex
is that you can ensure that you
get the right document, and not a working
document or an incorrect version.
When you click on the title
it takes you to the text,
and other formats that you might prefer.
The type of procedure that you find
about a document in EUR-lex leads you
to the legislative
institutional procedure,
where you can get links
to preparatory acts.
When you come to the state
eight section of the course you
will hear of this communication.
Go to EUR-Lex and
test if it is the exact title.
Use the search box,
paste the title and press Search.
If that doesn't work you can
pick words from the title and
paste it in the search box.
The search result is
ranked like in Google.
The first record in the list
is the one we are looking for.
Note that you have the text
available directly.
The note is as published in
the official journal C series.
If you want more information,
just click in the title as usual.
If you don't have the title but
the official journal number,
you can use it, this to find the document.
Looking at the number OJ,
that's official journal, C that's for
C series, and 372 is the serial number.
And date, year, and finally, page.
To find a text,
then you have this kind of reference.
Use EUR-Lex advanced search and
fill in the number.
And you will get only one match,
which takes you to the document.
The Commission also could use
documents like implementation reports.
They are not always
published in the same way.
If we like to look for
the latest implementation report regarding
the service directive, I suggest you
to start by using a search engine, such
like Google, Bing or Yahoo, among others.
When you have done your search,
look at the matches and
check the address to validate
the source where you pick the document.
ec.europa.eu is the official
homepage of the Commission.
The first match takes you to
the European Commission homepage for
the EU Single Market and
a page about implementation report,
the service package.
Further down on the page,
you will find the actual report.
Click on the link and
you will end up in EUR-Lex,
and you can see that the communication
is also published as a COM document.
Looking for documents from the commission,
you can find them in
the COM document series, official
journal or in the commission webpage.
Good luck with your searches and remember
to make sure you have the right document.
