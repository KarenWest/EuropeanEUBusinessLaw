Article 102,
previously actually Article 82, deals with
the unilateral conduct of undertakings
with substantial market power.
Article 102 one or more undertaking,
which holds a dominant position
in the internal market or in a substantial
part of it from abusing that
position insofar as it may affect trade or
inter-member-state trade.
For an infringement of Article,
102 to be established, five cumulative
elements must be fulfilled.
A, we need to have an undertaking.
The definition of undertaking
actually has the same meaning as it
does in Article 101.
B, it needs to be one or
more undertaking, which means that
independent under, undertaking may
actually together hold a collective
dominant position on an Article 102.
C, they need to be an effect
of inter member state trade.
And the definition of that is set out
in the commission's guidelines and
is based on case law
produced by the court and
it also holds the same
meaning as under Article 101.
However, the elements of
dominant position and E,
abuse, are particularly difficult
both to define and to establish.
And that, those two elements is
actually what we're going to discuss
in this lecture.
Now, holding on the dominant position
is not, though, you should know,
prohibited, only actually the abuse
of that dominant position.
That's a good thing to remember.
A dominant position was defined
by the Court of Justice in
the Hoffman-Law Roche and
the United Brands cases.
In terms that it tried to identify
the undertakings independent from
competitive pressure and its ability
to prevent effective competition.
Article 102 can only apply to undertakings
which are either singularly or
collectively [INAUDIBLE] position.
Nowadays, dominance is measured indirectly
by establishing dominance
on the relevant market.
The commission thereby uses quantitative
techniques such as small but
significant non-transitory increase
in price test, the SSNIP test.
And the case law seemed to establish
that once an undertaking reached 50% of
the market or
a 50% market share, there's something
akin to a presumption of dominance.
However as I stated before,
dominant firms are allowed to compete and
EU does not prohibit
dominant position as such.
Article 102 does also not apply to conduct
whereby non dominant firm actually
achieve dominance.
Now to talk a little bit about abuse.
The way Article 102 has been
interpreted by the courts and
the commission has been
quite controversial.
And it's still not entirely clear,
neither for lawyers nor
economists, how abuse
should be interpreted.
Article 102 has mainly
been applied to what we
call exclusionary abuses, while also
it actually had been applicable in
a few cases of what's called exploitative
abuses, such as excessive pricing.
Exclusionary abuses is a conduct which
impedes effective competition by
excluding competitors.
It has been applied predominantly
in a quite formalistic way,
focusing on the former conduct and
drawing presumption from that conduct,
rather than actually analyzing
the effects on the market.
Those have been said that
in some instances that
Article 102 has been applied in order
to protect competitors rather than to
protect the competitive process for
the benefit of consumers.
The definition of exclusionary
abuses was laid down also in
the Hoffman-La Roche case from 1979.
From that case, the court and
the EU courts has developed a difficult
distinction between competition
on the merit, which is allowed.
And conduct that amount to abuses,
where dominant firms may
have special responsibilities for
the competitive process to function.
The main exclusionary abuses which
are prohibited are predatory pricing,
exclusive dealing,
some forms of discounts and rebates,
tying one product to another,
refusal to supply another firm.
The general concern pricing strategies or
deal strategies that block or excludes
competitors from the relevant market.
The Commission wishes to modernize
the approach of Article 102.
It, it wishes to realign Article 102
to take in an effect-based approach,
directed to the objective
of consumer welfare.
Earlier, the Commission actually embarked
on a review and, and a modernization after
efforts for the application of
Article 102 to exclusionary abuses.
That result ended in the publication
of a guidance paper in 2009.
Specifically focusing on
exclusionary conduct, and how to
use the so-called as-efficient competitor
test in respect to pricing abuses.
The guidance paper is not intended
to constitute a statement of law.
Principle which will guide the commission
in deciding when to intervene and
in what cases to start to investigate.
However, it set stricter requirements for
establishing abuse in,
in comparison with earlier case law.
The commission is concerned with conduct
that has an adverse effect on consumers,
rather than, than competitors.
And they use, possibly,
a more economic neo-classic price theory
perspective when establishing
what commerce should be an abuse.
The EU courts has been very slow
to depart from earlier case law.
The court said that the as sufficient
competitive test in relation to predatory
pricing squeeze, but not in respect to,
to rebates and discounts.
Reasoned [FOREIGN] in
the Court of Justice for
example Tomra or the Intel case
has stated that the objectives of
competition law to be the protection
of competitors as well as consumers.
And the protection from
competition as such.
And to prevent competition from being
distorted to the detrimental of
public interest,
individual undertakings, and consumers.
There may be grounds to say that case
law from the court departs from conduct,
from the conduct by the commission.
And the court has a wide
notion what constitutes abuse,
at least from the perspective of what
the commission published in the guideline.
