In this lecture, we will focus on
Equality Law, which is a central and
well-developed part of EU Labor Law.
Equality Law has gradually extended
its reach beyond working life.
Equality law has a clear
human rights basis, but
also a market in economic basis.
The inclusion of the equal pay provision
in Article 119 in The Treaty of Rome,
now Article 157 of The Treaty of
the Functioning of the European Union, was
actually based on an economic rationale,
and the concern that some member
states could gain a competitive advantage
through the use of cheap female labor.
In time, the human rights and social
basis of Equality Law was strengthened.
EU Equality Law first contained
protection against discrimination on
grounds of nationality and gender.
EU law, in general,
builds on the development and
content of gender equality.
In 1999, through The Amsterdam Treaty,
the EU's competence in
the equality field widened significantly
through the inclusion of a new provision,
now Article 19 of The Treaty of
the Functioning of the European Union.
In 2000, two important directives
were adopted on this basis.
The Race Directive and
the Employment Equality Directive,
covering discrimination
on grounds of religion or
belief, disability, age and
sexual orientation.
This development is often described as
a move towards comprehensive equality,
which entails the protection of more and
broader discrimination grounds both
within and outside of working life.
The EU Charter of Fundamental Rights also
provides for equality before the law,
non-discrimination and
equality between men and women.
What then, about secondary law
in the area of gender equality?
Little happened until the 1970s,
when three gender equality
directives were adopted.
The Equal Pay Directive,
the Equal Treatment Directive, and
the Equal Treatment in
Social Security Directive.
Subsequent directives include
directives on occupational schemes and
on the self-employed.
Following the Maastricht Treaty
in the 1990s,
another set of directives was adopted.
The Directive of Pregnant Workers, the,
the Directive on Parental Leave and
the Burden of Proof Directive.
And later on, a directive on goods and
services was adopted.
The development of equality law has been
intertwined with social, political and
economic developments, such as increased
labor market participation for
women, increased migration, a shift
from standard to flexible employment,
an aging population and
restructuring and globalization.
The Equality Directives are generally
based on a human rights model.
The prohibition against discrimination
is designed as an individual right and
enforced through complaints to the courts.
And traditionally, discrimination
law was based on formal equality and
the premise that what is
alike shall be treated alike.
But EU law has recognized a role for
substantive equality.
That is, equality as regards outcome and
results.
For example,
buy bans on indirect discrimination,
rules on a reverse burden of proof and
provisions on positive action.
A proactive mainstreaming approach,
meaning that the EU in all its activities
and policies must aim to eliminate
inequalities and to combat
discrimination has also been developed and
enforced, and now enjoys Treaty support.
Today the Equality and Non-discrimination
Directives are aligned to a great
extent and contain protection in the form
of the prohibition on direct and
indirect discrimination, harassment,
and instructions to discriminate,
with scope for positive action and
a reversed burden of proof.
The Directives also contain provisions
on victimization, sanctions, and
remedies and procedures.
However, the scope of protection
differs between the Directives.
Discrimination based on gender
is prohibited in employment,
vocational training,
social security and goods and services,
while discrimination based on religion or
belief, disability, age and
sexual orientation is only prohibited
in employment and vocational training.
The protection against race discrimination
is the most far reaching, and
applies apart from
the areas mentioned before,
also to social advantages,
education, and healthcare.
Direct discrimination is closely
related to formal equality and
refers to the situation where
one person is treated less
favorably on grounds of sex or
another discrimination ground,
that in other ways has been, or
would be, in a comparable situation.
Direct discrimination requires no
motive or intention to discriminate.
It is enough if the less favorable
treatment is grounded upon.
For example, gender.
However, in principle,
there is a need to identify an actual or
hypothetical comparator.
And basically,
direct discrimination cannot be justified.
The ban on indirect discrimination
was first developed by the Court of
Justice and inspired by the concept
of disparate impact in American law.
The ban on indirect discrimination
targets measures which
are discriminatory in effect.
It refers to situations where an
apparently neutral provision, criterion or
practice would put persons
of one sex at a particular
disadvantage compared with persons of
the other sex, unless that provision,
criterion or practice is objectively
justified by a legitimate aim and
the means of achieving that aim
are appropriate and necessary.
Now, seven of the Sex Equality Directives
have been recasted and
are consolidated in the recast Directive.
Harassment is defined as unwanted conduct
related to the gender of a person,
or another protected discrimination
ground, with the purpose or
effect of violating
the dignity of a person, or
of creating an intimidating, hostile,
degrading or offensive environment.
And harassment is, per se, discriminatory.
The protection and
efficiency of Equality Law has been
increased by the reverse burden of proof
developed by the Court of Justice, and
later on codified in secondary law.
Persons who consider themselves
discriminated against have to
establish facts from which it may be
presumed that there has been direct or
indirect discrimination.
And it is then for the respondent
to prove that there has been
no breach of the principle
of equal treatment.
The Court of Justice clarified early on
in the Dekker case that discrimination
on grounds of pregnancy constitutes
direct discrimination on grounds of sex,
as pregnancy is intrinsically
linked to the female sex.
In these cases,
there is no need for a comparator.
The Directive on Pregnant Workers
aims to implement measures to
encourage improvements in the safety and
health at work of pregnant workers and
workers who have recently given birth or
who are breastfeeding.
Workers are entitled to a continuous
period of at 14 weeks of maternity leave.
The aim of the Parental Leave Directive is
to lay down minimum requirements designed
to facilitate work-life balance.
Men and women are entitled to
an individual right to parental leave,
which must be granted for
at least a period of four months.
But the member states decide
themselves whether parental leave
should also be paid.
And now, do you remember,
does EU law provide protection against
discrimination on other grounds
than nationality and gender?
Yes.
The Race Directive and the Employment
Equality Directive provide protection
against discrimination on grounds of
racial or ethnic origin, religion or
belief, disability, age or
sexual orientation.
In addition, Article 21 of the EU Charter
contains a so-called open list
of non-discrimination grounds.
The Race Directive states that direct
discrimination requires one person to
have been treated less
favorably than another.
Despite this, the Court of Justice found
in the case of Firma Feryn that a public
statement by an employer that he would not
recruit employees of a certain ethnic or
racial origin constituted
direct discrimination,
even though there was
no identified victim.
This has been called discrimination
by declaration, and Firma Feryn
has later been confirmed in the accept
case relating to sexual orientation.
The Employment Equality Directive,
like the Race Directive,
contains protection against direct and
indirect discrimination,
harassment, as well as a rule
on a reverse burden of proof.
In relation to disability, there is a
requirement for reasonable accommodation.
In Coleman, a woman was found to
have suffered discrimination when
she was treated less favorably and
harassed because of her son's,
not her own, disability.
So called, transferred discrimination.
The legal regulation of age discrimination
stands out in some respects.
The protection covers both old and young
people, and discrimination on grounds of
age can be justified to a greater extent
than discrimination on other grounds.
And this has to do with the traditional
role age is assigned in the labor market.
According to Article 6, member states may
provide that differences of treatment
on grounds of age shall not constitute
discrimination if in the context
of National law they are objectively and
reasonably justified by a legitimate
aim such as employment policy, labor
market and vocational training objectives.
The means also have to be appropriate and
necessary.
In recent years,
much of the case law from the Court of
Justice has evolved around
age discrimination.
The first case was Mangold, in 2005, which
created a lot of attention and debate.
Here, the Court of Justice declared that
not only was age discrimination covered
by the Directive, but also that EU law
encompassed an independent general
principle of non-discrimination
on grounds of age,
which might have some form
of horizontal application.
Many of the cases have dealt
with mandatory retirement.
The Court of Justice basically
deems mandatory retirement rules
to be age discriminatory, but
these rules can be justifiable.
And the member states have been given
a large margin of appreciation, and
when applying Article 6, the court has
found the differences of treatment on
grounds of age to be justified by
legitimate aims, such as intergenerational
fairness, prevention of humiliating
forms of termination of employment and
a reasonable balance between labor
market and budgetary concerns.
In addition, the means for
achieving these aims have frequently
been found appropriate and necessary.
EU Labor Law and Equality Law will
continue to face important societal and
economic challenges.
These challenges relate for example,
to enlargement and the continuing variety
in member state's labor law systems,
increasingly segmented labor markets and
vulnerable groups of workers, an aging
population and high youth unemployment.
The key question will be how to
find the appropriate balance
between competing interests as
well as between competing rights.
Thank you very much.
