Most public procurement contracts
are governed by the treaty.
Certain provisions of the treaty prohibit
in general government actions which
discriminates against firms or
products from other member states.
And this includes discriminatory
public procurement.
As we have already mentioned above,
these principles of the treaty
have direct effect.
That is, they are binding on member state
governments and enforceable against them.
It should also be stressed that
these treaty provisions imply,
they apply in principle to all
contracts awarded by public bodies.
This includes those contract
which are outside the scope of
the procurement directives, for example,
because their value is below the financial
thresholds for the EU directives to apply.
The most important articles are article
34 concerning the free movement of goods,
article 56 on the freedom
to provide services, and
article 49 on the freedom
of establishment.
The treaty also forbids member states
from giving assistance to industry.
State aid,
except in certain circumstances.
The award of a public contract
may constitute unlawful state aid
under the treaty when the contract is not
in the nature of a commercial transaction.
For example, when the state pays
a contractor a higher price
than the market price.
The different EU member
state traditionally have
had different approaches to distinguishing
between private and public law.
Some states have never made
a general distinction.
Although they may have various
different rules that apply only to
public bodies or activities.
Other member states have separate
systems of administrative public law and
have traditionally adopted general
classifications of particular bodies or
activities in their economies as public or
private, for
the purpose of deciding which system
will apply to them, including for
the purpose of determining the scope of
their domestic public procurement rules.
However, in terms of the entities covered,
as well as the type of contracts covered,
the procurement directors have
a common scope for all member states.
So, the court in
the C-283/00 Commission versus Spain,
SIEPSA, as emphasized that the concept
of a body governed by public law.
For example, has a common meaning for
all member states and thus the,
not necessarily correspond with
the definition of public or
administered borders in
the state's domestic law.
In other words, the relevant definition is
the one in the directives themselves, and
not the definition used in
the domestic law of the member states.
There are five objectives to be met when
dealing with public procurement matters.
One, the value for money.
The efficiency in the acquisition
of goods, works, or services.
Two, integrity, avoiding corruption and
conflicts of interest.
Three, accountability.
Four, equal opportunities and
equal treatment for providers.
And five, fair treatment of suppliers.
The public sector bodies covered by
the directive are referred to as
contracting authorities.
Now this concept is
defined in article 1(9) of
the public sector directive to
cover four distinct categories.
The state.
The local and regional authorities.
Bodies governed by public law.
And associations formed by the above.
The directives apply to public
contracts in writing for
pecuniary interest consideration,
which are either public work contracts,
public supply contracts, or
public service contracts.
And all of these are defined in article
1(2) of the Public Sector Directive.
Works contracts are contracts for
carrying out works or a work.
A supply contract is the one for
the acquisition, purchase,
lease, et cetera of products.
A concept of a services contract covers
procurement contracts which are not
works or supply contracts.
And previously the three types
of contracts were dealt with by
different directives.
However, the main rules that
apply to the three different
types are virtually identical.
Unlike some pro, procurement regimes,
the directives apply the same fram,
framework of rules to all
three types of contracts.
Leaving member states to draw any
appropriate distinctions between them,
for example, over the types of
award procedures suitable for
different contracts.
And member states may also leave
this to the procuring entities.
But there are, however, some differences
between the different types.
In particular,
there is a much higher thresholds that
apply to works contracts than
to supplies and services.
There are some differences in
the availability of the negotiated
procedure with a notice for
the different types of contracts.
And some services contracts
are not fully regulated, but
subject only to very limited obligations.
The directive applies only to contracts
above certain financial values,
the thresholds.
And these seek to identify contracts for
which there is likely to be
cross border competition.
In many EU member states,
as in the national procurement systems
of many other countries, competition
is mandatory at much lower thresholds.
To promote domestic
objectives such as value for
money and elimination of corruption.
But the directives are concerned merely
with opening up trade across borders and
so have not regulated smaller contracts.
The directives lay down lots
of detailed rules about how
major contracts should be awarded.
In addition, it is very important to note
that the court held, prior to the adoption
of the new directives in the 243 from 1989
Commission versus Denmark on Storebaelt
on the case 84 87/94, the Commission
versus Belgium, the Walloon Buses.
But there are some fundamental general
principles underlying the directives.
In particular, one,
the principle of equal treatment.
Two, the principle of transparency.
And three,
that entities must act non-discriminatory.
This appears to restate the principle of
non-discrimination on grounds of nation,
nationality under the treaty, and
is simply one specific application of
the more general equal treatment
principle under the directives.
The equal treatment principle
under the procurement directives,
has been defined as foremost
in the joint cases 21/03 and
34/03, Fabricom versus Belgium,
the Fabricom case.
And I quote, the equal treatment
principle requires that comparable
situations must not be treated differently
and that different situations but
not be treated in the same way, unless
such treatment is objectively justified.
End quote.
The court has not yet
given a general definition on
the principle of transparency, but
it has been suggested that in general,
in procurement,
this concept has four distinct dimensions.
Namely, the publicity for contracts,
the publicity for rules of the process,
limits of discretion, and the provision
for verification and enforcement.
The available procurement
methods are the open procedure,
the restricted procedure, the competitive
dialogue, the negotiated procedure with
a notice, and
the negotiated procedure without a notice.
In all award procedures
under the directive,
the process of deciding which
suppliers are to be excluded for
these kinds of reasons is
regulated by the directive.
The directive significantly limits
an authority's discretion in this area in
two ways.
They permit firms to be excluded only
on certain limited grounds listed in
the directives, including financial
position and technical capacity.
They also control
the process of exclusion,
including the evidence that may be used.
And these rules seeks to ensure
that authorities provide fair
opportunities of participation.
And that procedures for assessing
qualification are not unduly burdensome
and do not provide opportunities for
authorities to conceal discrimination.
We can use the phrase contract
award to refer to the stage of
the award procedure in which the procuring
entity decides which of the qualified and
responsive tenderers has
submitted the best tender.
As it noted there the award may sometimes
be based on simply the lowest price or
may also involve consideration of
other factors such as quality.
This applies also under the EU rules.
Under the EU rules the same rules on
contract award apply to both open and
restricted procedures.
Under the EU rules the main purpose
of the rules and award criteria is to
secure transparency in the application
of the award criteria so
that in particular discriminatory
decisions cannot be concealed.
Once tenders have been received,
in both an open or restricted procedure,
the contract must be awarded on the basis
of one of the two criteria in article 53,
the lowest price or
the economically advantageous tenderer.
Under the lowest price basis,
the award goes to the lowest tenderer.
Many authorities use this only for
simple purchases where the nature and
quality of items offered does not vary
much between different suppliers.
Under the most economically
advantageous tender principle,
the authority may award the contract
to the firm whose tenderer is
the most advantageous,
take into account all relevant factors.
In the public sector right
of an article 53.1 a,
we have a list with various factors which
could be used such as price, quality,
running costs, after sales service,
and delivery date as well as price.
The list of the directives
is not exhaustive.
However authorities may use other factors
mentioned in the C-19/00 SIAC construction
case, or the case C-513 from 99,
the Concordia bus case.
Where the authority proposes to use the
most economically advantageous criteria
for award, public sector directive
Article 53.2 expressly requires that it
must disclose in the contract notice or in
the documents the criteria to be used and
the relative weighting
of these award criteria.
This weighting may be expressed
as a range with a minimum and
maximum weighting where the authority
considers this appropriate.
For example, an authority could perhaps
assign in the documents a weighting of
80% to price and 20% to quality.
Or state in the documents that
the weighting will be 80 to 85% for
the price and
15 to 20% for quality and later decide on
the more precise weighting in that sense.
Note that there is nothing to
indicate that the concept of
weighting refers to percentage.
An indication of how criteria are to
be weighted could thus involve
other approaches, such as a Ponce system.
Efficient enforcement of the field of law
is of utmost importance or complies with
the rules and the European legislature
has made extra efforts in order to ensure
effective reinforcement of the EU public
procurement rules at a national level.
The European Commission showed early
awareness of the need of fast and
efficient enforcement of
the public procurement rules, and
this led to the early adoption of the so
called remedies directives.
The directives 89/665 and
directive 92/13, applicable for
the classic sector and
the utility sector respectively.
The remedies directives
were recently amended and
developed by the remedies
directive in 2007, directive 66.
The remedies directives allow
a wide degree of discretion for
the member states and
there are substantial differences
between the enforcement regimes
at a national level in the EU.
Enforcement of the public procurement
rules also takes place at
a supranational level as the European
Commission supervises the compliance of
the member states with
obligations under EU law.
That follows from the article
258 in the treaty.
That commission has used in that
procedure in several cases in
the field of public procurement.
As a starting point, remedies and
procedural law concerning breach of
EU law are to be considered matters for
the national legislature according
to the principle of national and
remedial autonomy.
This autonomy is subject
to a number of limitations,
namely the principles of equivalence and
effectiveness.
It follows from the principle of
equivalence that the substantive and
procedural conditions for a remity for
breach of EU law must not
be less favorable than those
relating to similar domestic claims.
It follows from the principle of
effectiveness that the conditions for
remity must not make it virtually
impossible or excessively difficult to
obtain reparation, which is
the formulation from the Francovich case.
Article 2A-2 of the remedies directive
introduced a basic standstill provision
according to which a contract may not
be concluded following the decision to
award a contract for the expiry of 10 or
15 calendar days depending on
the chosen means of communication
of the award decision.
Another important standstill provision
was introduced by Article 2(3),
according to which
Member States shall ensure that
the contracting authority cannot conclude
the contract before the review body has
made a decision on the application, either
for interim measures or for a review.
It follows from the remedies directive
that the review bodies must be
able to award damages to persons injured
by the infringement of the rules.
However, the details of, of the issues
concerning damages are not regulated in
detail and their formulation does not
contribute much to the creation of
a clear legal situation, and
even generates doubts on some points.
It is not even clear from
these directives whether they
require the possibility of
an award of a lost profit or
not, which is of crucial importance for
the efficiency or the remedy of damages.
The remedy of ineffectiveness is a very
important remedy introduced
by the Remedies Directive.
It is in particular a remen, remedy
against direct illegal award of contracts.
It follows from Article 2d(2)
that the consequences of
a contract being considered ineffective
shall be provided for by national law.
Nevertheless, according to the same
provision national law may provide for
their retract of cancellation
of all contractual obligations,
or to limited obligations which
still have to be performed.
Furthermore, Recital 13 makes clear that
ineffectiveness essentially implies
that the rights and obligations of
the parties under the contracts should
cease to be enforced and performed.
