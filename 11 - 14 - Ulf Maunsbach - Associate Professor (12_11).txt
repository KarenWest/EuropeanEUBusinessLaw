Professor Ulf Maunsbach.
>> Yes.
Yes.
>> Associate Professor Ulf Maunsbach.
>> That's more correctly.
>> More correctly.
Welcome to the faculty room.
To beautiful day in Lund, and
we are going to talk about
your contribution to our MOOC.
>> Yes.
>> But maybe as a start, will you be so
kind to say a few words about yourself and
your background?
>> Yes, I would, would love to.
My name is Ulf Maunsbach as stated.
And I have been here at the faculty for
quite a long period of time.
I started as a law student, and
then conducted a PhD project.
And thereafter I have been
acting as a teacher and
researcher here at the faculty of law.
So, I have along it,
it goes a long way back my, my,
my time here at the faculty of law.
And I'm involved in private international
law which is one of my major topics, but
also intellectual property law,
and primary trademark law.
And so you had from the beginning, right?
>> Yeah, yeah, yeah.
>> Because your doctoral thesis was about
the intersection between private
international law and trademarks.
>> Yeah, more or less.
Or, exactly.
>> But what was the name of it?
>> It is actually,
a Swedish dissertation unfortunately.
But, but a, a translation would be Cross
Border Aspects of Trademark Infringements.
>> When was this presented?
>> In 2005.
>> 2005, so
nine years have lapsed since then.
Have you been continued to
doing research in the field?
>> Yes, definitely.
I do have a continuous interest in
the cross-border aspects of law and
primarily, the intersection between
private international law, and
intellectual property law.
So a majority of my, my research
is still conducted in this area.
Which is, I would say,
an area where you can find quite a lot of,
quite a complicated problems still.
>> Mm-hm.
>> So
there are, there are issues to,
to deal with still.
>> Have you published yourself
nationally or internationally?
>> Yeah, yeah well being a Swede.
When I write in Swedish it is there
are no recent publish outside Sweden.
But I do publish quite
a lot in English as well.
So there are quite a lot
of publications since 2005.
>> 20 or so.
>> Accessible.
>> Some of them, yes.
And they are available quite
a lot of them on my home page.
So, so yeah.
If you're interested in this question,
the question
of how to deal with intellectual property
law in an international context.
There might be something to find.
>> Talking about you and experiences.
You have also experiences
from outside the faculty.
>> Yes.
Dealing with intellectual property
law means that you work quite
closely with practitioners.
It is a very practical topic and
that applies at, at least in my
perception also to private international
law and cross border conflicts in general.
So, I work quite a lot with
practitioners locally here in,
in Lund and in this region.
But in teaching we also have, I would
say this is one of, of the benefits.
By being at the faculty of law and
learning, we have an awful lot
of international networks.
We try to a large extent
to connect our teaching and
research activities to
international networks.
>> Like what?
In my topics, and in my teaching, for
instance, we do cooperate with the OHIM,
which is the registration office,
the European Union registration office for
trademarks and designs in Alicante, Spain.
And we work with WIPO,
the World Intellectual Property
Organization in Geneva.
And they are visiting us and
teaching, and since recently,
we have a close cooperation with UNCTAD,
also a UN organization located in Geneva.
And they are also happy to,
to come here and helping us out
with teaching assessments, and
also doing some networking together
with the staff of the faculty.
So, I visited Geneva this summer for a
network meeting, I will come back to Lund
hopefully next spring to to
participate in our master courses.
And that I would say is a great benefit.
>> What are you presently
dealing with in your research?
>> I'm still into this intersection,
the cross-border aspect.
My primary focus is private
international law and trademark law.
And at the moment, I'm quite occupying by,
by commenting writing a review or comment
in relation to the Swedish trademark Gat,
which is heavily influenced
by European law.
I'm also involved in
a project which aims at
trying to describe some kind of
European perception of trademark law.
In the field on private national law,
my focus at, at the moment
would be on enforcement issues.
>> Mm.
>> And there are plenty of issues.
One example this summer we had
a workshop here at the faculty of
law with invited scholars
from Beijing in China.
Some of our colleagues from different law
schools in China focusing on enforcement
of private law in general and
how you, to put it briefly,
how you effectuate or make right
work in practice, and protect them.
Not only intellectual property rights,
but all, also other property rights.
And I do hope that this project,
this project with our Chinese
colleagues will, will develop further.
That would be one research topic and
interesting comparative
analysis with a European Union perspective
and Asian Chinese perspective.
>> Very [COUGH] very interesting.
I know that in your teaching at
the faculty, you are both involved in
private international law and
the trademark law teaching.
Is, is that what you're contribution
is to this MOOC as well?
>> Yeah, well, partly at least.
My contribution to this
MOOC primarily [COUGH] is,
is within the theme of
intellectual property rights.
So, I'm involved in that,
that block of lectures.
>> Mm-hm.
>> Focusing on trademark law.
But I almost forgot to mention,
since my dissertation,
it's focused particularly on,
on aspects related to the internet.
And I do teach in, in,
information technology law as well.
So I will provide one or
a few lectures in this
MOOC regarding IT aspects of
intellectual property rights.
And there are quite a lot.
>> So, IT and trademark,
an overview of trademark or very in depth.
>> I would call it an overview definitely.
And the aim with my participation and
the contribution in the lectures is of
course to provide a general knowledge
as to European Union trademark law.
And focusing on the, the general aspects.
But there will be some,
some in-depth presentations.
But not as thoroughly, thoroughly as,
as our master courses here
at the faculty of law.
So, so, participants will have to, to.
>> Just start with the MOOC and.
>> And then, they will come to the,
and follow my European and
international trademark law
class here at the faculty law.
>> Lund or any other courses offered out
in Europe, in a European [CROSSTALK].
>> No.
Only Lund, of course.
>> Yes.
>> No, but there are plenty
of possibilities of course.
If you're interested in international
property law, but Lund is one option.
>> Do the students have to prepare
before they listen to your courses, or
is it rather that they go through
the course and they work afterwards?
>> I have prepared my lectures so
that they should not have to prepare much.
>> Okay.
>> There are assessments within
the lectures.
Hopefully that would be my ambition.
It will be possible to
follow starting with
the introductory lecture following on
with, with, with the topical lectures.
It will possibly, be possible to follow
without preparing that much in advance.
>> I'm asking all the other
contributors eh, to the MOOC about eh,
the present Euro crisis and what impact
it will have on their specific subject.
So I'd like to ask you to,
to what extent will
the present unrest in Europe
affect work with the intellectual property
rights and trademarks, particularly.
>> Well in my opinion,
it's quite a tricky question in
the field of intellectual property law.
So I would say that there are no
obvious direct impact, but
quite obvious indirect impacts.
Of course the Euro crisis affects the,
the willingness for, for
financiers to invest in innovation for
instance.
We had one,
one nearby example here in England.
the, the establishment of
the European splaylation source and
learned major European union investment.
It has turned out to be very problematic
to, to gather investments and
and get member states to,
to agree on finance.
And that of course affects, at a later
stage, possibilities to conduct research.
And that in turn affects in,
the innovative climate.
>> Mm-hm.
>> And there we, we can talk about patents
and trademark protections, and so on,
and so forth.
So, so no obvious,
in my opinion, direct effect.
>> But it's something the students
can have in the back of his or
her mind while studying your course on,
your section on trademarks.
>> Yeah well they, they are happy to,
to contact us with suggestions as to how
the Euro crisis is affecting this topic.
now, I would happily discuss it, but,
but yes they,
they should be aware of it, I think.
>> Thank you very much.
>> Thank you.
