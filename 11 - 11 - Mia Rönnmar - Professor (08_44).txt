Good morning, Professor Mia Ronnmar.
>> Good morning.
>> Welcome to the faculty room.
>> Thank you.
>> We're here surrounded by old
professors and the faculty.
We're going to talk about eh,
your contribution in the labor law
section of the MOOC, but maybe as a start,
could you please introduce yourself?
>> I'm a professor of private law but
my specialized areas are labor law and
industrial relations.
So researching to working
life more generally.
And I study these areas from
a Swedish national perspective.
But also from an EU perspective and
comparative perspective,
so that is my speciality.
And within my professorship,
I am also Editor in
Chief of an international scientific
journal, with a very long name,
The International Journal of Comparative
Labor Law and Industrial Relations.
And apart from that-
>> You have some international
assignments, as well?
>> Yes.
I'm the Swedish expert in one of
the European commissions expert legal
networks in the European labor law.
>> Let's go back in history a bit.
>> Yes.
>> What, you wrote a dissertation once.
When was that and what was it all about?
>> It was finished ten years ago, 2004.
It was a comparative research
study on Swedish, German, and
UK labor law, and I studied the subject
of managerial prerogative and
how the employers' rights are balanced
against the employees' rights and
actually also the duty to perform
work within the employment contract.
>> So labor law.
>> Labor law.
>> From the beginning.
>> [CROSSTALK] Definitely from
the beginning. >> Have you continued in
your research with labor law?
>> Yes, I have.
So that has been my main field
of research and expanding my
research into EU labor law more
specifically and comparative labor
law into other national arenas, apart from
those I studied in the doctoral thesis.
>> Are you published internationally?
>> Yes, I, I am.
I regularly publish through
international channels,
so I have edited a number of books for
international publishing houses.
And I've published journals in
international peer review journals.
>> Mm-hm.
And some of them are accessible?
>> Yes, they are.
>> Yeah?
>> They are accessible through
the traditional channels but
also through websites and
the website at my home University.
>> Yeah.
Yeah.
>> So you can go to the Lund University
website and find a lot of your.
>> Yes.
If you find me there,
you can find my works there.
Yes.
>> Great.
What are you presently doing?
>> In my research,
I am presently conducting two projects.
One is a project within
the Norma Elder Law research environment.
>> What is Norma?
>> Norma, Norma is a research program
that has a rather long history here at
the faculty.
It's an interdisciplinary
research environment.
Gathering more than 15 different
researchers in the field of labor law.
But also family law,
social security law, and EU law.
A recent project,
a large project that we have started
within this program is on Elder Law.
So interdisciplinary studies
of the legal situation and
protection of, of elderly people.
>> Mm-hm.
>> And
my focus is then on the older workers.
So I study different labor
law aspects of older workers.
>> I guess that you probably are focusing
on labor law in your teachings,
is that correct?
>> Yes that is correct.
>> Yes.
>> So I actually teach labor law at
all different levels.
So at undergraduate level,
I am head of the course in labor law.
Private law in the social dimension.
I also provide some specialized
courses at, at the masters level.
And then, of course, I supervise
doctoral students in labor law.
>> And
what is your contribution to this MOOC?
>> Well, I'm presenting a number of
a lectures within the EU labor law field.
So I've chosen some specific key
topics also topical topics so
of, of interest today,
that sort of provide an overview of
the current state of EU labor law,
but also of its development.
>> The student who is now going
to embark on your course, what,
what should the students really expect
from going through your lectures?
>> Yes, I hope that they will gain
further knowledge and insights,
also critical insights into
the development of EU law in this area.
Some key aspects and, and
also very importantly, how EU labor law
interacts with national labor law, because
this is an area of shared competence.
So, some aspects of labor law are still
regulated at the national level,
others at EU level.
And there are frequent tensions
between those two levels.
So that is some-
>> The student is going to
come up as a labor law expert?
>> It's difficult to provide
that kind of expert insights or
knowledge within just six brief lectures,
but that it will provide
basic knowledge and create a lot of
curiosity to further the studies.
>> Will the student have to prepare him or
herself before starting?
>> No, I think that if the student has
taken part, and, and listening, listening
in, into other lectures before, describing
the general background of EU law,
they can just go ahead and, and
listen to the lectures on EU labor law and
then, afterwards, move on and
read different reading assignments.
>> There is a question that I
have been asking the others.
And that is, I'm suggesting
that Europe is in somewhat of
a crisis at the moment and
it's affecting also the legal areas.
And the, some,
most of the people are confirming that,
yes it is actually having an, an impact.
But what about labor law?
Will, would the present crisis
have any impact on labor law?
>> The economic crisis have had
a massive impact on labor law.
EU labor law as well as labor laws in
the different national member states,
because there are so
many member states that have been
reforming the national labor laws, been
forcing through hard austerity measures.
And, and these reforms have really
reshaped the landscape of labor law in
many, many different member states.
And what has also been
very much criticized and
discussed within trade union or
trade union groups but
also within the scholarly community
is the way in which, actually,
these reforms have violated
fundamental labor rights and
this is not just something that
scholars think or criticize.
But there are also international human
rights bodies, such as the IMO and
the Council of Europe that actually have,
have criticized these kinds of reforms.
So this is, there is a real sense of
urgency in a way, within the labor law
area in Europe about where, what direction
the EU is, is heading and, and how to-
>> So the whole area is
very topical at the moment.
>> Very, very topical.
>> And we would just get started
with the studying in your course.
>> Yes, yes.
>> Thank you very much.
>> Okay, thank you.
