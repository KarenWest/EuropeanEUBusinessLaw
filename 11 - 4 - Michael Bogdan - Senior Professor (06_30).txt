Professor Michael Bogdan,
Senior Professor here at the Law Faculty.
What a pleasure to sit here and
discuss with you in
preparation of our MOOC course.
>> Thank you very much.
>> You are a senior professor, but
could you please tell us a little
bit about your own background.
>> Well I'm,
I was born in what is today Slovakia.
>> Mm-hm.
>> But I've been living in
Sweden since 1968, roughly.
I've worked at the Faculty
of Law since 1971,
when I started as a doctoral candidate.
Now I've partially retired and,
as you mentioned, I'm a senior professor.
>> When did you present
your doctoral dissertation.
>> I defended my thesis in 1975.
>> And what was it about?
>> It was about expropriation, of property
in, in private international law.
>> Okay, so, already in 75, you, you
started with private international law.
>> Yes.
>> And did you have produced quite some,
a, research since then.
>> Yes, I have writing and
teaching in private international law.
Then I have also done some research
work on comparative law, and
public international law, and private law.
But mainly, my main focus has always
been private international law.
And we can't really go through them now.
because we're talking about
several hundred of pieces.
>> Well my, my number of my publications
by now is roughly 450 or something.
But of course many of
them are minor pieces.
Book reviews, things like that.
>> Are they available on the net so-
>> Well articles of course available
to the extend the journal in question.
>> Right.
>> It, it's on the net.
It's a different story with the books-
>> Mm.
>> Being publishers, of course,
are not too happy the books
are generally viable free of charge.
>> As a senior professor,
are you still active in doing research?
>> Yes I'm I don't,
I can't say my life has
changed much when I retired to partially
still working practically full time.
>> Mm-hm.
And what is your ongoing project?
>> I've several textbooks that I use to
[INAUDIBLE] Old Swedish universities.
And have published textbooks and
become a slave because you have to keep
them alive all the time, things change.
So right now we have to start updating.
>> Revising and updating them?
>> Yes.
>> You are now contributing to our MOOC
and what is, what is your lectures about?
>> I've produced two
lectures of 15 minutes each.
About 15 minutes.
And they both deal with
private international law.
It's a kind of presentation of
that field of law to people who,
perhaps never studied law, and have no
idea what that subject is all about.
>> It sounds like it's
general international law.
Does it have an EU implication?
>> Yes, it, it, it does, it does.
brief, during the recent years,
the EU has kind of,
almost taken over the legislative
process in that field.
So today I would venture to
say that more than 50% of
Swedish private international law.
Is based on either directly
applicable regulations, or
maybe it's a question of
transposed whose from directives.
>> What should the students expect
as a learning outcome after
having gone through your classes?
>> Well private international law.
Or maybe I should mention that
the Americans don't know what it is.
They call it conflict of laws.
>> Hm.
>> It's a very complex subject.
It deals with record, with,
with jurisdiction of courts to deal with
international disputes having some
kind of international context.
The applicable law with recognition for
judgments.
And during 30 minutes with
those two lectures, I,
my ambition is limited to then explaining.
To the viewers what
the subject is all about so
they understand it, and
hopefully become interested in it.
>> And then of course you will follow up.
Once they come to Lund if
they come to Lund you,
you have a separate course on the subject.
>> I have a separate course master
course and elective course on
European private international law.
>> Europe is, presently,
in some kind of trauma.
They talk about a crisis.
It's affecting all kinds
of economic areas.
Has it any impact on your field?
Or is it a.
>> Well to, to some, some extent.
I mean, large part of my,
my subject leads me to conclusions
like family law for instance.
International families.
Those are not directly affected.
But I also, the unit,
the subject also covers for
instance trans border,
cross border bankruptcy.
And there's a crisis with the bankruptcies
then many companies that have creditors or
debtors in other member states.
And rise to complications.
To that extent you could say that
some parts of the are effected.
>> Do you have a chance to deal
with bankruptcy in your courses?
>> Yes.
It's part of what yes.
Sure.
>> Sounds like an important subject and
we look forward to working with you.
The segment that you have presented.
Thank you very much.
>> Thank you.
