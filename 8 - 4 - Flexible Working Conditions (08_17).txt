EU labour law also regulates
important issues which
affect the individual
employment relationship.
In this lecture we now turn to
a discussion of the regulation of
flexible work and working conditions.
The flexibilization of the labour market
has led to an increase in flexible work,
such as fixed-term work, temporary
agency work, and self-employment.
In recent years, EU labour law and
employment policy have
been greatly influenced by
a flexicurity agenda inspired, for
example, by the practice in
the Netherlands and Denmark.
Flexicurity is about combining flexibility
for employers and security for
employees, and aims at reducing
labour market segmentation and
increasing economic growth.
But flexicurity is also partly about
deregulation of employment protection,
combined with equal treatment of
various forms of flexible employment.
It is also about effective,
active labour market polices.
Reliable and adaptable systems for
lifelong learning and
modern social security systems.
Today, flexicurity is part of
the European Employment Strategy and
the Europe 2020 Strategy,
and has been criticized for
focusing predominantly on labour
market flexibility and deregulation.
The part-time work, fixed-term work, and
temporary agency works directives
form part of this flexicurity agenda.
The part-time work and
fixed-term work directives result
from the European social dialogue.
What are then the aims
of these directives?
First of all, the aims differ in part.
The purpose of the part-time
work directive is to provide for
the removal of discrimination
against part-time workers.
And to improve the quality
of part-time work,
while also facilitating the development of
voluntary part-time work, and contributing
to the flexible working time in the
interest of both, employers and workers.
The purpose of the temporary agency work
directive is to ensure protection of
temporary agency workers and to improve
the quality of temporary agency work.
While also taking into account the need
to establish suitable framework for
the use of temporary agency work
in order to create jobs and
develop flexible forms of work.
The fixed-term work directive is more
restrictive as regards flexibility, and
its purpose is to improve
the quality of fixed-term work by
ensuring the application of
the principle of non-discrimination.
And to establish a framework to
prevent abuse arising from the use of
successive fixed-term
employment contracts.
Thus, the first two directives want to
encourage this type of flexible work,
while the third directive has an emphasis
on the protection of a flexible workers.
The principle of non-discrimination and
equal treatment has not been given
a coherent design in the directives.
In the Part-time Work Directive and
the Fixed-term Work Directive, there
is a principle of non-discrimination.
Which states that in respect of
the employment conditions, part-time, or
fixed-term workers, must not be treated in
a less favorable manner than comparable
full-time or permanent workers,
solely because they work part-time,
or have a fixed-term contract.
Unless that differential treatment
is justified on objective grounds.
In these two directives, the principle
of non-discrimination is limited,
since it requires that any unfavorable
treatment of the part-time worker or
the fixed-term worker is to relate
solely to the part-time work or
fixed-term employment contract.
It also enables the employer to justify
such unfavorable treatment with
objective grounds.
By contrast,
in the Temporary Agency Work Directive,
the principle of equal treatment states.
That for the duration of their
assignment at a user undertaking,
the basic working and employment
conditions of temporary agency workers
must be at least those which would
apply if the workers had been
recruited directly by that
undertaking to occupy the same job.
There is no possibility of
justifying different treatment.
But there are some important exceptions
to the rule, including allowing states
the possibility of not applying
the principle of equal treatment for
a certain period.
Employment protection is an important
element of National Labour Law, and
the protection of individual employees.
What do you think?
Do EU labour law provide
employment protection?
Yes and no.
At EU level, employment protection
is only partly regulated.
There is no EU employment
protection directive.
Instead, we find patchwork
regulation in Article 30
of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.
The Fixed-term Work Directive.
The Transfers of Undertakings Directive.
The Collective Redundancies Directive,
and in the different Equality Directives,
which have banned
discriminatory dismissals.
Working conditions and their improvement
is an important aspect of EU
labour law and there is regulation on
health and safety and working time.
The framework directive on health and
safety aims at measures to encourage
improvements in the health and
safety of workers at work, and
lays down minimum standards in this area.
Another directive is the Working Time
Directive, which aims at laying down
minimum health and safety requirements for
the organization of working time.
The directive contains provisions on
daily rests, breaks, weekly rest periods,
maximum weekly working time,
annual leave, and night work.
Article 31 of the EU Charter of
Fundamental Rights on fair and
just working conditions also states,
every worker's right to
an annual period of paid leave.
In recent years, the Court of
Justice has delivered a series of
judgments in relation
to paid annual leave.
The court has emphasized that
the entitlement of every worker to
paid annual leave must be regarded
as a particularly important
principle of European union social law
from which there can be no derogations.
The Working Time Directive and
the Court of Justices case law in this
area is controversial and has been
difficult to align with the demands of
certain sectors, particularly healthcare.
Several attempts have been made to revise
the Working Time Directive in recent years
but so far they have proved unsuccessful.
To sum up, EU labour law must be
considered when regulating
the individual employment relationship.
Thank you very much.
