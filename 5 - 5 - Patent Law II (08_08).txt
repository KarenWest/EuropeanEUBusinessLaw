As we learned in the previous lecture,
harmonization of EU patent law
only consists of one directive,
the directive on biotech inventions.
In spite of failure of up until now,
to establish a unity right within the EU.
National patent law has
obtained a rather high level of
adjustment to the European
patent convention.
I will therefore concentrate this lecture
on the European patent convention.
The grant and procedure for
a European patent is completely
regulated by European Patent Convention
and its Implementing Regulations.
It's an Ex Parte Administrative procedure,
which ends up with a grant or
refusal of a patent.
Applications are filed either
directly to the EPO, or
by filing via the PCT with
the EPO as one designated office.
The first stage of the procedure comprises
an examination of filing, formalities
examination, preparation of the European
Search report, and the preliminary opinion
of possibility and publication of
the application, and the search report.
And the second stage comprises
the substantive examination and grant.
The application must contain a request for
the grant of European patent.
A description of the invention, one or
more claims,
drawings referring to the description.
Or the claims and an abstract.
The application must also disclose the
invention in a manner sufficiently clear
and complete, for it to be carried
out by a person skilled in the art.
After the granting, any third
party may file an opposition with
the EPO against a granted
patent within nine months.
As I previously said, one should be aware
of that the criterias for patentability
has been extensively harmonized,
given the normative influence of the EPC.
Let us now see if
our company's product can be patentable
under the European Patent Convention.
The first task is to make sure that a
company's product satisfy as an invention.
An invention is the discovery or
creation or a new material, or
product, a new process,
a new use for any existing material.
Or any improvements of any of these.
And what matters is a precedence
of technical character.
European patent can be granted
in any field of technology,
if it fulfills the requirements.
Some subject matters are not
regarded as patentable invention.
And that is discoveries, scientific
theories, mathem, mathematical methods,
aesthetic creations, schemes, rules,
methods for performing mental acts,
playing games or doing business,
and programs for computers.
And even presentations of information.
The requirements in Article 52 EPC
states that the patentable invention
shall possess novelty, inventive step,
and industrial applicability.
An invention is considered
industrial applicable,
if it can be produced or
utilized in any kind of industry.
Through requirement,
novelty is quite strict.
To be novel,
the invention must be absolutely new, and
it can therefore not form part of
the world-wide state of the art.
It must be world-wide new.
Everything made available to the public by
means of written or oral description, or
by use or in any other way,
before the date of filing of the European
patent is not considered new.
An invention shall be considered
as involving an inventive step.
If, having regard to the state of the art,
it's not obvious to a person
skilled in the art.
The person skilled in the art should be
presumed to be a skilled practitioner
in the relevant field of technology, who
possesses average knowledge and ability,
and is aware of what was common general
knowledge in the art at a relevant date.
In order to assess inventive step,
EPO have developed a"
problem-and-solution" approach.
The problem and solution approach
contains of three main stages,
which is one,
determining the closest prior art,
two, establishing the objective
technical problem to be solved.
And three,
considering whether not the claimed
invention starting from
the closest prior art and
the objective technical problem, would
have been obvious to the skilled person.
Anyone who files a patent application
in a country that is, a signatory
of the Paris convention, has to write
to within 12 month, file an identical
application in any other country, and
claim priority from the first application.
The first application is,
the basis of the right to priority.
In terms of novelty, priority means
that the company's later application
is regarded as having been filed at
the same time as the first application.
A patent cannot be granted if
the invention is excluded from
patentability according to
the European Patent Convention.
The following inventions
are excluded from patentability.
Inventions where the commercial
exploitation would be contrary to
"ordre public" or morality.
Plant and animal varieties are essentially
bio, biological processes for
the production of plant or animals.
This provision shall not apply
to microbiological processes, or
the products thereof.
Methods for treatment of the human or
animal body by surgery or
therapy, and di-,
diagnostic methods practiced
on the human or animal body.
This provision shall
not apply to products.
In particular substances or compositions
for use in any of these methods.
If the patent is granted,
the patent duration will be 20 years,
calculated from the application and
subject to annual fees.
A prolongation of the time is possible.
If the basis of, on the basis of
the EU Council Regulation number 469
from 2009, and number 1610 from 1996.
The supplementary protection
can be at maximum five years.
Limitations and
exceptions are not addressed in the EPC.
To sum up, if the company intends to
apply for a patent in just a few European
countries, it may be better to choose the
national route and file the application at
the IP offices in the countries for
which the company are seeking protection.
Otherwise the company can try
to obtain patent protection in
Europe at EPO upon one single application.
And if it's granted,
it gives them a European patent which
contains a bundle of national patents.
