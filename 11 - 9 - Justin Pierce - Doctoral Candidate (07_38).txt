Justin Pierce,
I'm very happy that you're here and
that you're a part of the MOOC team.
Maybe you could give a little
presentation of yourself.
>> Certainly I can answer it.
Well, my background is
quantification from England,
Wales where I qualified at the bar.
With the,
a little bit of lecturing along the way.
Before I met a, a lovely Swedish woman and
moved my life to Sweden and
joined the University of Lund.
Where I am currently researching,
a bit about halfway through my,
my thesis at the moment.
>> So you are an Englishman?
>> I am an Englishman, yes.
>> Okay.
And.
You have been a practicing attorney.
>> I have practiced in England
predominantly in commercial law.
So a lot to do with companies,
a lot to do with contracts and
a lot to do with procurement and
the relationship between government
organizations and, and companies.
>> In this course,
you are teaching competition law.
Have you been working with it,
competition matters specifically?
>> Not specifically with
competition matters, but
work quite a lot with
licensing matters which is
obviously very influenced by competition,
intellectual property.
>> Mm-hm.
>> And various of the commercial
aspects which have a nature which is
influenced directly by
competition considerations.
You said that you had been
a teacher in England.
>> Yeah.
>> And you're a teacher in Sweden.
>> Yeah.
>> Is there a difference?
>> There's a, there's.
>> Are you working in a different way?
>> I find myself working
in a very different way.
I think in in England it,
it was very intense,
with larger classrooms and
a larger number of students.
Sweden, there is a,
it's a lot more disscussive.
The depth is, is, is greater.
And there's, there's a greater room for,
really developing and
getting into the main issues.
So, yes I find myself being drawn more
in to, into the discussion in Sweden.
>> Mm, sounds good.
>> It's very good.
>> Where are you in terms of research,
your own research?
>> My own research really has
an intersection very similar to Bjorn's in
relation to the crossroads between
intellectual property and competition.
And then added to that is the,
the sort of focus being on article 102.
Where I I really look at the way
intellectual property can or
can't be used in
a standardization setting.
And where competition law may,
can come into regulate or not.
>> Mm-hm.
>> As, as the case may be.
So there is going to be, be a dissertation
coming out of this research?
>> There will definitely be a dissertation
coming out of this research.
>> And, and what's the topic of it?
>> The the, the, the title of
the the dissertation at the moment is
The Gordian Knot, Unlocking Innovation
Through Standardization and Competition.
>> Have you been able to publish
anything else, meanwhile?
>> Yes.
I've been involved in the editing of two
volumes of books, which look at
the regulation from tax perspective.
From a commercial perspective in relation
to NGOs and charities around the world.
I have also produced a few articles in
relation to competition, fundamental
rights, and the rights of defense that
companies have under EU competition rules.
And most recently,
a paper which is due to be published in
an international journal on
the inhibiting effect of innovation.
Sort of the strict
application of competition.
>> How would you describe your
contribution to this course?
>> I think my contribution to,
to this course is,
very much dove-tailed into, into Bjorn's.
And I bring to it really up to
date knowledge on Article 101.
And the procedural matters and
the issues that surround companies and
dealing with the commission.
And the commission dealing with companies.
And those are the lectures
that I cover in this,
I think I bring a very practical
aspect to and hopefully,
the students have that practical
experience makes it a little bit easier to
understand some of the more complicated
issues that surround the competition.
>> So you have divided it,
the material between yourself.
You are covering article 101 agreements.
And Bjorn is covering more the unilateral
activities of a dominant enterprise.
How, what do you expect, or
what should a student expect that he
will have learned after
going through your section?
>> Well, we try to give, if I, if I
coin the phrase, a helicopter overview.
So, really a, a general picture of what
competition law is in the European Union.
What its function is, and, and
very generally how it, how it works.
And within all of that, we identify a lot
of the issues that are unresolved, as yet.
And I think that what
really makes this course so
interesting, is that students
come away with a solid knowledge,
a general knowledge of
what competition law is.
But more importantly, and hopefully,
they see that there are still issues to be
resolved within competition law and
its effect on the market and on companies.
And of course,
if they go on to study further,
those are the issues that they
would find the most interesting.
>> It's a huge area.
>> It's a massive area.
>> When you think about it, I mean,
when you think about all the legislation.
All the case law.
>> Hm.
>> I wonder if there is any other area
which is as much developed in
the Union as the competition.
>> Perhaps I'm I'm, I'm,
not impartial in the answer.
But for me, competition law is
the sexiest part of European Union law.
It has everything that you would want.
You have the economic factors, you have
the operating of business and your
right to contract, your, your fundamental
freedoms to be able to do that.
It has an impact on the consumer,
it has an impact on the employee,
on the employer.
It really is, it is everything that you
would, you would want to be studying.
>> And you are able,
in a couple of lectures,
to give some type of overview and
hopefully the students will feel that this
is an area where they had to dig deeper.
>> It's an area that I find, for
myself, anyway, that it's never
enough just to scratch the surface.
So, hopefully, we have scratched
the surface, and the students get
infected by that competitional bug,
and really do dig deeper.
And, as you said, there's a lot for
them to dig deeper into.
We have lots of legislation.
Lots of case law and lots of text.
>> Mm-hm.
Thank you.
We look forward to starting
with you on the course.
>> Yeah, thank you.
