The last two decades have
seen an increased focus and
interest in trademark law.
A trademark is no longer a mere identifier
and guarantee for quality, but also
a communicator of commercial messages,
and a carrier of enormous values.
The increase in attention is
visual in the jurisprudence.
From an EU perspective,
trademark law was quick to become a focus.
And as result of this focus
it became the first of
the IP areas that was
harmonised across the Union.
The first harmonisation directive
entered into force in 1989 and
the Trademark Regulation,
establishing a separate system of
community trademarks was launched in 1994.
Today, both the directive and
the regulations are replaced
by codified versions.
But the fact remains,
since the beginning of the 1990s,
trademark law has been harmonized
within the European Union.
The starting point for
our discussion will center on
the previously mentioned trademark
directive, and the trademark regulation.
Although the Paris Convention and
the TRIPS Agreement, discussed during the
introductory lectures are also relevant,
they are of less direct importance.
In addition to the trademark
specific legislation,
there are further acts that
interrelate with trademark law.
One example is the enforcement
directive and further
examples are directives in
the field of marketing practice.
Moreover, it is relevant to
recall that competition law and
rules of free movement of goods
are closely related to IP law in general.
Case law development
occurs in two situations.
First, there
are the preliminary questions.
Where courts from member states
are asking the European Court of Justice,
as to the interpretation
of the trademark directive.
In addition to that,
there is administrative case-law.
This latter group of cases are a result of
the introduction a community right system
with an administration of registration
at Office for Harmonization, UHIM.
Administrative decisions, for
instance, a refusal to approve
a trademark registration may be appealed.
And during that administrative process
that follows, both the general court and
the court of justice may be activated.
This two-fold system produces crucial but
rather non-transparent material.
Henceforth, I will refer to the trademark
directive, but corresponding provisions in
the, the community trademark
regulation will be highlighted.
It is recommended that you have
access to the directive to be able to
follow the lectures in trademark law.
One specific aspect of trademark law,
is the fact that trademarks, in contrast
to other copyrights, may be infinite.
All other item rights have a limitation
in time as to the term of protection.
And thus,
a trademark can live before ages.
An illustrative way to identify relevant
aspects of trademark law is therefore to
relate different relevant rules
to the life span of a trademark.
Some rules are applicable due
to the birth of the right.
Others are mainly applicable during
the life of a trademark, and
finally some rules apply in relation
to the death of the trademark.
During this lecture, and
the lectures to come, I will focus on
foundational principles of European Union
trademark law, and I will mention
provisions in the trademark directive,
that becomes relevant along the lifespan.
Rules that governs the birth or creation
of trademarks would be such rules that
deals with prerequisites for
protection and exceptions from protection.
And you'll find such rules in
Article 2 and 3 of the directive.
Then there are rules that governs
the exercise and use of trademarks.
That would be the Life of the Right.
Relevant in relation to what
the proprietors allowed to do
with a trade mark?
Such a rules ought to be found in article
5 de, dealing with infringements.
Articles 6 and 7 dealing with limitations
and article 10 dealing with use as such.
And finally, there are those rules.
One example would be article 12 dealing
with revocation that governs how and
when a trade mark may be terminated and
consequently deceased.
The lifespan of a trademark may also be of
use to illustrate the development of case.
As was indicated above,
there are both preliminary judgements from
the European Court of Justice and
administrative decisions from OHIM.
The General Court and
the Court of Justice.
This latter group contains cases
that deal with the registration of
Community trademarks.
Example says, a denial of registration
and, or objections to registration.
And the legal background is to be
found in the trademark regulation.
The premin, preliminary judgments on
the other hand are based on a need to
interpret the trademark directive.
And a majority of those cases surround
an interpretation of the use and
exercise of trademarks.
These two groups of cases are based
on different legal grounds.
But it is important to note that
the substantive rules in the trademark
directive and in the trademark regulations
all formulated in an identical manner.
Therefore, it is necessary
to consider case law from
both groups in order to fully understand
European Union trademark law.
During next lecture, I will proceed and
develop dis, discussion as to
the creation of the right.
Before that, however, it's timely
to conclude that the trademark,
as a principle rule,
is a registered right.
Consequently, it is relevant to do
a search in the trademark registry and
secure that the sign that is to become
a trademark application is available.
Before we discuss the prerequisites for
protection, thus it is time to resume
acquaintance with the company.
The company is about to introduce a new
information tool that is to provide
patients with updated information on
specific diseases and provide guidance for
self care.
The service will also include
a secure encrypted service,
where patients can receive direct
access to their own health records.
And the working name for
this service, as we have been formed.
Is InfoMed.
And our first task is to do a trademark
search, to find out whether or
not it is a sign that is
available in the registry.
So, for the purpose of this course,
it's suffice to do a simple
search using OHIM services.
But you are, of course, allowed to
conduct, additional searches on your own.
Good luck.
See you soon.
