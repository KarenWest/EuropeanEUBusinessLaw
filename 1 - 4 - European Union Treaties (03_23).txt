In this section, I'm going to talk
about European Union treaties.
I will answer the questions, what
are the treaties and where do I find them?
Well your teacher might ask
you to read article 36 TFEU.
Then you need to know what is TFEU?
How do I find it?
EU legislation takes
the form of treaties and
EU regulations, directives, and decisions.
A treaty is a binding agreement
between EU member countries.
It sets out EU objectives, rules for
EU institutions, how decisions are made,
and the relationship between the EU and
its member countries.
TFEU is the Treaty of the Functioning
of the European Union.
There is also TEU,
the Treaty of European Union.
On this page, you can find both
in a consolidated version.
Lets click on the TFEU.
In this page,
you find access to the treaty in
every European Union member language.
You can choose whether you prefer to
access the document in HTML or PDF format.
You will have the text as it is published
in Official Journal, or in a plain text.
I click on the PDF symbol.
This is the first page of
the Consolidated Version Of The TFEU.
On the top of the page you find date,
the title, Official Journal of
the European Union, the series C,
number of the issue, and page.
The document is divided into many
different parts where number one is
the start.
Usually the last one is the Tables Of
Equivalences, where you'll find old and
new numbering of the articles.
Going down in the document, we can find
the article we are looking for, number 36.
In brackets, we can read the old
number of this article, number 30.
In the previous, Nice Treaty,
TEC treaty establishing the European
community, which was the old name of TFEU.
So, how did I find this page?
You can find this page in the European
Union legal document database, EUR-Lex.
You find information about the treaties
looking at the third tab, EU Law and
related documents > Treaties.
There are also other ways of
having access to the Treaty.
If you prefer to have the Treaty as
an e-book that you can download to your
phone or tablet, you can find
a nice version in the EU Bookshop.
In the webpage of EU Bookshop
you can find a list of
titles from the bookshop
about EU Treaties.
Here you can find the title,
Consolidated versions of the Treaty
on European Union and the Treaty on
the functioning of the European Union.
You can easily download the book to
a tablet, or to your mobile phone.
Another book that could be useful is How
the European Union Works: Your guide to
E.U. institutions.
On page four, you can, for example,
read about the history of the treaties.
Thanks for listening, and
welcome back to the next session,
where we're going to talk about
European Union Secondary Legislation.
