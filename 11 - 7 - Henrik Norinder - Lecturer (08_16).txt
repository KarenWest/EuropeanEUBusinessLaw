Good morning, Henrik Norinder.
It's a real pleasure to have you here.
I've just been talking to and
she was just coming in for
a day, and then she's back to Luxemburg.
You are a real lone person,
you are probably the most
active teacher at the faculty.
>> Yes, I probably am.
I, I do teachings in, in contract law in,
in administrative law.
In competition or in public
procurement and also in [INAUDIBLE].
>> Yes, that's fairly broad, right.
>> It's,
it's a broader variety of things I do.
>> What is your background to be
able to teach in all these areas.
>> Well I started off here and then I
left to do work outside the faculty.
And then I was working for a 15 years
at the department of business law and
also as a practicing lawyer.
So I have a background in
both teaching elsewhere.
But also in, in the normal practical law.
And especially in competition
where I'm procured.
>> Do you have any theoretical.
I know your practical background and
that you have frequently been consulting.
>> Yes.
>> Have you been active scientifically?
>> I've I haven't made
any dissertation yet.
There might be one in
procurement later on.
Apart from that,
yes I've written a few books in terms of
teaching books on EU law and
case law and in competitional.
But apart from that, no.
So I'm more of the practical person.
I'm more of the.
In court.
>> Mm-hm.
>> Or in, in, in legal practice.
>> Does that show in anyway
in your teaching methodology?
>> Yes, I would say so.
I, I liked really much to give my students
the possibility to see the practical.
Impact of things and also to, to persuade
them to see that there are things that
might happen in, in, in a case or
with the relations, with a client.
Rather than being something that
you could just, not just, but
still theoretically review or
to see but there are also
practical implications that you need
to have, when doing business school.
>> Problem based learning?
>> I would say so, yes.
Because otherwise
students won't be active.
You need to formulate problems
with the students, but
also give them the opportunity to
provide the answers to problems.
>> In the classroom.
Are you doing the work, or
are the student's doing the work?
>> Well it depends.
I would say that I do part of the job.
But I,I am trying to find
the coaching method rather than to
being the one that just
talks to the students.
Because that is more like a monologue and
the interactions are important to me.
I want the students to intergrate.
>> And now you're involved in the MOOC,
and what areas are you involved in?
>> I'm doing parts of the internal
markets in terms of a company.
And I'm doing labor movement and
procurement.
>> Mm-hm.
Is there a specific theme
in these different courses?
>> Yes, I would say that the theme is both
the question of cross-border activities.
>> Mm-hm.
>> And most importantly,
you would see that in company law aspects,
on the establishment issues,
and also in procurement.
And of course, when we talk about physical
persons, moving from one place to another.
>> Mm-hm. Mm-hm. >> So, it's
the cross-border activities that really,
>> Mm-hm.
>> Is my thing, in that sense.
>> Mm-hm.
When we look at your sections,
will we see any of your methodology,
in terms of it, or is this more of
a traditional type of teaching?
>> I would say, I would say that in
terms of, of the presentation it's, it,
it's probably more traditional but also, I
think that, in terms of the questions put,
that you will also see the, the more ki,
kind of practical impact of this.
>> Mm-hm.
>> So, eh, what I've tried to do in
traditional ways in terms of
the teaching will also have
an impact on the non-traditional
parts of the questions.
>> Mm-hm.
What should the students expect from eh,
after they have followed these sections?
Will they be experts in
the areas like you are, or eh.
>> That would be nice.
[LAUGH] But I,
I do have a realistic on that tense.
And that would be for them to have that
good profound knowledge and understanding.
What would the problem sort
of typically problems to be.
>> Mm-hm.
>> In terms of, what happens in,
in terms of a company who wants
to move to another country.
What happens for
a physical person to move.
>> Mm-hm.
>> Or in procurement matters when
do you expect problems based.
>> Mm-hm.
>> On a corresponding activity.
>> So,
it's a kind of a basic start in this MOOC.
It's base also if you come to
learn this fee especially.
>> Exactly
>> You can follow up
>> Because then you can follow up and
have more of the details
about these subjects.
Specifically since we teach them.
I teach them on the program
>> Do the students need to prepare
themselves for starting these courses?
Or can you just do it and?
>> I, I, I think that you can just do it,
because part, part of this is inherent
in the internal market system.
So it's more a way to see that
the ordinary solutions to it.
In terms of, of non-discrimination,
in terms of,
of equal treatments
are perfect starting points.
And then to see, to,
to actually apply those parts, and
those solutions,
to these areas with problems.
I am asking all the teachers
participating in the book
to what extent the present European
crisis is affecting their area.
Is it affecting your areas?
Can you see,
>> Of course.
it, it definitely concerns
the question of procurement,
where you would say that
national aspects concerning.
To protect your own natural
markets will be, have an impact.
Unfortunately, you could say that in
terms for, for persons we definitely have
a question on a European crisis level for
individuals to move from
one to another and, and which is a,
even further crisis later on.
>> Mm.
>> But also in terms of establishment
issues whereby you would say that it
might be more and more hurdles on the way.
>> Mm.
>> To have a complete European
>> Mm-hm.
>> Company based sort of
establishment possibility.
>> Would you say that there is a bit
of a hold in the European development
at present?
>> Yes.
My understanding is that even though
we will have a new commission,
and it's sort of diversed itself
into different areas, we, we, have
a problem with, with member states looking
for a kind of a democratic deficit.
>> Mm-hm.
>> In terms of policy issues.
>> Mm-hm.
>> In terms of understanding why the EU
should do something or
not to do something.
>> Mm-hm.
And that crisis to me will have
an impact on the possibility for,
for unig station, and they might go back
to and sort of late 70's, early 80's,
activists mainly by the courts,
which we saw then, and we might see now.
And you might see Europe
develop after its crisis?
>> Absolutely, because there's
always some kind of development.
The question is what kind of
development that we will foresee.
>> We will think about that when we
follow your courses here in the MOOC.
>> Absolutely.
>> Thank you.
>> Thank you.
