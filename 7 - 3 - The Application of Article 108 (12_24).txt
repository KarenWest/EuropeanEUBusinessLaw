Hello and welcome back.
In this lecture we are going to look at
the procedural aspects of state aid law,
what is commonly called state aid control.
This is also part of state aid
law where political aspects of
the topic can be illustrated.
Before we go into the substance
of this lecture I just want to
say that I hope you have familiarized
yourself with article 180 FEU and
with regulation 659 999 also referred
to as the procedural regulation.
If you haven't had the time,
I suggest that you look
at least at article 108 TFEU to
get an overview of this lecture.
Before we go into the details,
let me give you a brief outline on how
the state aid control system is set up.
The purpose of state aid control,
as we noted in the earlier lectures, is to
control state interventions in the market.
This system is supervised
by the European Commission.
Only the commission can
declare a state aid
measure compatible with
the internal market.
The commission cooperates
with the member states.
The member states must notify state
aid measures to the commission so
that the commission can make its
assessment whether the aid is
compatible with the internal market, or
whether the measure is an aid at all.
Pending this assessment, the member
state may not put the aid into effect.
This is the so-called
stand-still obligation.
The relationship between the commission
and the member states is an exclusive one.
And beneficiaries and their competitors do
not play a direct role in that procedure.
However, beneficiaries and
competitors play an important indirect
role as sources of information.
Individuals in undertakings
can also submit complaints to
the commission if they know or
suspect that somebody receives state aid.
Moreover they can also use national
courts to stop a member state
from paying state aid until the commission
has made its assessment of the measure.
This in short is how
the system is designed.
Now let's take a closer look
at how the system works.
As I said in the introduction
the member state must notify new
state aid to the commission.
This means first and
foremost that aid must be new.
If it concerns an existing aid
measure age which has already been
cleared by the commission the measure
does not have to be notified.
More importantly if it
concerns existing aid
the stand still clause in article
108(3) TFEU may not apply.
The control of existing aid is
regulated through article 181 TFEU and
specified in the procedural regulation.
According to the treaty the commission
shall in cooperation with member
states keep under constant review
all systems of aid existing there.
It's only if such an existing aid
is changed in its substance that
the stand-still obligation in
article 108(3) TFEU applies.
And the aid must then be notified
to the commission as new aid.
This means that an aid measure which
the member state wishes to introduce or
any substantive change that
the member state wishes to
make to an existing aid scheme must
be notified to the commission.
You'll find this principle in the first
sentence of article 108(3) TFEU.
However, there are exceptions.
Because a strict application of these
rules would be prohibitively disruptive in
the economy, there are a number of
types of aid that the commission has
declared are presumed compatible
with the internal market and
therefore do not need to be notified.
These types of aid
are defined through block
exemptions which are introduced through
regulations adopted by the commission.
The block exemptions contain
very detailed rules on how and
what aid the commission would accept.
They cover aid such as environmental aid,
agricultural aid, and
soon possibly infrastructure aid.
So, in short, new aid must be
notified to the commission unless
it is covered by a block exemption.
The stand-still obligation is a very
specific feature of state aid control.
Before the commission has declared an aid
compatible with the internal market,
the aid must not be put into force.
This is regulated by the last
sentence of Article 108(3) TFEU.
According to which a member state may
not put the proposed measure into effect
until the con, control procedure
has resulted in a final decision.
The types of decision which
are considered final is regulated in
the procedural regulation.
Article 108(3) TFEU has direct effect.
This means that the provision can
be invoked before national courts.
The court of justice has emphasized
that national courts must be
able to prevent the member state
from putting a measure into effect
if the commission has
not cleared the measure.
If they have questions they can always
refer the case to the court of justice for
a preliminary ruling
under article 267 TFEU.
This is also the case if
the measure has not been notified.
Many member states failed to report
all their new aid measures and
changes to existing aid
measures to the commission.
The procedure in article
108(3) TFEU is also meant
to apply to these categories of aid.
So, in short, if a measure constitutes
state aid in the meaning of article 107-1
TFEU, it must not be put into effect until
the commission has made its assessment.
National courts may decide
to enforce this prohibition.
Now let us look at the assessment
the commission makes and
the procedure linked to that assessment.
In another lecture you have been told
about the criteria and the conditions
under which the commission can declare an
aid compatible with the internal market.
Using articles 107(2), 107(3),
and 106 TFEU here we are going
to focus on the procedural aspect.
The foundations for the procedure are
found in article 108(3) and 108(2) TFEU.
I mention them in reverse order
because that is how they apply.
According to the middle sentence
of article 108(3) TFEU after it
has received a notification and if it has
doubts whether the aid may be compatible
with the internal market, the commission
shall initiate the procedure provided for
in article 108(2) TFEU.
This is an obligation.
A decision not to open the formal
investigation procedure can be
challenged before the general court.
Now, article 108(2) TFEU.
Mainly states that the member
state concerned must be allowed to
submit comments.
The details of the procedure are laid
down in the procedural regulation.
Basically, the procedure looks like this.
The decision to open the formal
investigation procedure is published in
the official journal of the European Union
with an invitation to submit comments.
Then the member state and
any other interested party can submit
their comments to the commission.
The commission then usually
goes a second round or
more with the member state concerned and
then issues a final decision.
During the procedure the commission
may issue a number of
procedural injunctions to ensure the
corporation or the member state concerned.
There are three types of final
decision that the commission can
issue at the end of the investigation.
It's a positive, a conditional,
or a negative decision.
A positive decision means that
the aid is declared compatible with
internal market and
can be put into effect.
A conditional decision means that the aid
is declared compatible on the condition
that the member state concerned takes
certain measures to adapt it so
that the commission can accept it.
Finally, the negative decision
means that the aid is
declared incompatible
with the internal market.
This aid must not be put into effect and
if aid has already been paid,
it must be recovered from the recipients.
Recovery is mandatory in such a situation.
It's only if it's absolutely
impossible to recover the aid that
the member state may
escape this obligation.
If it fails to do,
the commission can open an infringement
proceeding under Article 108(2) TFEU.
If the commission takes a decision not to
open the formal investigation procedure or
takes a negative, conditional,
or even positive final decision,
the decision can be appealed to
the general court of the EU.
The court will make an assessment
of the law as well as the facts,
but will leave the assessment of
complex economic assessments largely to
the discretion of the commission.
An appeal can be brought by a member
state or by a party concerned.
There is ample case law on who may or
may not be considered concerned.
Beneficiaries, for instance,
are generally considered to be concerned,
while their competitors find
themselves in a gray zone.
After a judgement of the general
court this can be appealed to
the Court of Justice.
The ECJ does not make a second
assessment of the facts but
only makes a control of the legality
of the judgement of the general court.
If the appeal is successful, the case may
be referred back to the general court
unless the ECJ has enough information
to decide the case itself.
The full procedure takes many years.
Often the final judgement at
the end of the chain comes up
to five years after the original
measure was taken by the member state.
So, to conclude this odyssey
through state aid procedure,
I hope that you have gotten a general idea
about the system of state aid control and
the procedure that comes with it.
Thank you for tuning in and
see you soon again.
