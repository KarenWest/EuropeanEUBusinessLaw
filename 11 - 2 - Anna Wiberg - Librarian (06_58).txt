Good morning, Anna Wiberg.
It's about 11:00 in the morning.
We're in the library.
Normally I'm saying,
welcome to the library,
to teachers coming in here, but maybe
this time you should say welcome to me.
You're the librarian.
>> Yes.
>> Could you say a few
words about yourself?
>> Yeah, sure.
I'm one of the librarians working
here at the Faculty of Law.
And we're actually six librarians.
And I have been working here for
quite a long time.
I've been working here since 2003.
And one of the things that I'm
working with quite a lot is to teach.
So I'm teaching here, about how to
search for documents, how to find them,
how to evaluate them, and yeah, that's
one of the things that I'm doing here.
>> Could we say a few
words about the library?
>> Yeah, sure.
>> It's a big library.
>> It's a big library, yes it is.
It's a big library.
>> How big?
>> How big?
It's one of the biggest in
Northern Europe I think, yes.
And it's on four floors.
And it's open quite a lot and it's a, yes,
it's a very much used library as well.
So it's it's a busy library.
>> Specializing in anything particularly?
>> Well one of the things that we
have specialized in is sort of,
is European documentation.
Of course,
we are a European Documentation Centre.
>> Since?
>> Since 1974.
>> Since long, yes.
>> It's a long time, yes it is.
It's it's a, you shouldn't expect it so
that long maybe, but
it is a very long time.
>> Today, do we receive these stacks
of information from Brussels, or
how is information coming today?
>> Oh, the information,
it's online today, more or less.
>> It's virtual?
>> Yes it is, but
still we receive from Brussels.
We do, actually, by post as well so, it's-
>> Is it a good library in the sense of
having access to the virtual
library community?
Do we have-
>> We have access to quite a lot.
>> Yes.
>> Online, yes.
We have actually quite many databases and
so, so
it's difficult to say how big the library
is just looking at it, because it's so
much that you can't see that is online.
But, talking about European documentation,
then nearly everything is online.
There are so many publications that you
can't find in a printed version today.
And of course you need to be
aware of them to find them.
>> And the library is for
us as researchers-
>> and the students, of course.
>> Equally?
Students have access to everything?
>> Yes.
>> More or less?
>> Oh, more or less, yes, yeah, yeah.
>> And what about the general community?
Can anyone use this library?
>> Yes, they can.
It's it's one of the things
we need to do is,
is to, to open up the doors for
everyone to access.
And that is especially important with the
European documentation, so everyone can
access these as we are,
these kind of documentations, and-
>> So you are teaching now in our course-
>> Yes.
>> About the information.
>> Yes, about it.
>> What are you doing?
If, if, can you summarize in a way?
>> Yeah what I'm going to
try to explain is how to
find the different documents
used in the other courses.
>> Mm-hm.
>> So
this is supposed to be
some kind of support to
the students taking this course.
How to find relevant documents, and
how to know that I have the actual
document that we, I'm supposed to look at,
so I'm not sitting with a wrong version,
or a document that is not
the consolidated version assigned.
I will also explain a little bit how
the structure of different documents are,
and the different types of documents
used within European documentation.
>> So, how much will the student
have learnt after doing this course?
Because it's a fairly,
it's a summary, it's a-
>> Yes, there, they will know
about European Union documents,
how and what kind of legislation
documents there are in cases, and so on.
And I think that they can use my films
in a way that they can take a course,
and then they need a document, and they
could go back to, to my introduction and
find out how, how did I get this kind of
document, or how do I use this document?
So I hope that my courses
could be some kind of,
support during the whole course,
instead of a separate course of its own.
>> Perfect.
Library is a very static.
Nothing ever changes in the library.
>> [LAUGH].
>> Is that true?
>> No.
>> It is not true.
>> Everything is changing.
>> One thing that is changing, and which
I noticed with respect to European law,
is that we are not getting references
to court cases in the same way anymore.
There is a new system
introduced at the moment.
>> Yes, it's changing, yes.
>> Ilkley?
>> Ilkley is the new name
of the number that we
are recommended to refer to
European Union Case Law, yes.
>> Here I have, for more than 50 years,
been saying European Court Report.
>> Yes.
>> I'm not supposed to
say that in the future.
ECR?
Or-
>> No, not as the recommendation is today,
no, no.
They are changing it.
It's just in the middle of the change so,
I wouldn't-
>> Do you know why they are changing it?
Is it-
>> It is to make it, them more searchable.
>> Hm.
>> To make it easier to include every
case within European Union countries.
So, it's not only-
>> Also, the national cases.
>> Exactly.
So, it's not only
the European Union cases.
>> Well, obviously there is
something to learn also for
an experienced researcher here.
>> Yes, I hope so [LAUGH].
>> Okay.
>> Okay.
>> Well,
we look forward to looking
at your different classes.
>> Thank you.
>> Thank you.
