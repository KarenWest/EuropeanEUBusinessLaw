Hello and welcome to this
session on European tax law.
The goal of this tutorial is to
provide you with an overview of
the applicable EU law as it stands
today in the field of taxation.
It's a fascinating legal
area where lots of
political debate tends to
underlie each and every question.
Indeed, governments are faced
with a policy dilemma.
They have to strike a balance between
the need to finance domestic welfare
by letting high taxes and at the same time
keeping those who voted for their content.
In addition they also need
to attract foreign capital.
And address the issue of their
domestic tax bases disappearing in
the globalized world.
Where capital moves so easily.
Political choices have to be made within
the boundaries of the EU legal framework.
You may have read about
Google in the news.
The internet search giant
which only paid a tax rate of
2.6% on $8.1 billion in non U.S.
income in 2012.
Because its channeled almost all of its
overseas profits to a subsidiary in
Bermuda, where no corporate
income tax is levied.
Almost all the profit terms from non
US clients, in form of license fees for
the use of Google intellectual property
is transferred perfectly legally.
Out of high tax jurisdictions.
And this is now triggering a debate in
the G20 on how to find a better way of
taxing multinational corporations
according to their ability to pay.
The material I'm going to
cover is organized as follows.
First, I'll give you some
elements of tax policy.
Before describing the sources of EU
law applying in the field of tax law.
After this introduction we'll
take a tour of the world for
issues of relevance to your basic
understanding of this topic.
All states have a private and
a public sector.
The public sector is financed by taxes.
That are levied on the economy activities
carried on in the private sector.
In the market economy,
economy transactions in
the private sector come about through
voluntary agreements between individuals,
however taxes are not the result of
a voluntary decision by individuals.
They're imposed on tax payers by national
political decisions of parliament and
other political subdivisions.
The primary purpose of taxation
is to create space for
public sector activities to
the detriment of the private sector.
Taxation is therefore the most
important economic and
social policy instrument for
each national government.
So it's no wonder that
taxation is still so
central to the sovereignty
of member states.
And then, of course you have to keep
in mind that the European Union,
not being a federation, has no power
to levy taxes for its own budget.
That's also another reason why the member
states of the European Union still have
the sovereign power to levy
taxes on their own territory.
There is no general.
EU level income tax nor
does the EU benefit directly from
the member state's tax revenue.
What's more, another really important
feature of this discipline is
that member states have to agree
unanimously on any secondary legislation.
And all though this has occurred
it's been in a limited fashion.
Member states are at liberty to
determine the size of public sector they
wish to create.
And they're free to choose the tax systems
they consider most appropriate to their
In other words they determine the tax
mix applicable within their own borders.
A statistic shows,
public sector size varies tremendously
from one member state to another one.
The European Union,
is relatively high tax area,
with tax revenues representing
almost 40% of national GDP's.
Denmark, Belgium, France,
Austria, Finland and
Sweden, each have a large public sector.
When the tax revenue
reaches 45% of the GDP,
that is 7% higher than the EU average.
As a starting point, you might wonder
what kind of taxes we're talking about.
Taxes can be classified from an economic,
legal, or tax policy viewpoint.
From an economic viewpoint, taxes are
usually levied on three kinds of items.
Labour, Capital and Consumption.
Taxation on labour includes
personal income tax and
to a certain extent,
Social Security contributions, but
I'll leave those contributions outside
the scope of this presentation.
Taxation on Capital.
Includes taxes on corporation and
investment income as well as property and
inheritance taxes.
Taxation on Consumption includes value,
added tax, and excise duties.
VAT applies to the value of the goods and
services that are bought and
sold for domestic consumption.
Goods and services sold abroad,
exports, are not subject to VAT,
in the country of origin, but
in the country of destination.
Conversely, imports are taxed so
as to keep the system fair for producers.
Excise duties are often levied
to improve people's lifestyle.
For instance tax on tobacco, or
to encourage environmentally friendly
production tax on harmful emissions,
for instance.
From a legal viewpoint taxes
are classified either as direct taxes,
those which are levied on taxpayers
directly, or indirect taxes.
Which are levied on consumption but
remitted by
taxpayer who passes on to the consumer
the economic charge of the tax.
As that's the case of the 80 and
excised duties.
From a tax policy viewpoint it is well
known that some taxes are more conducive
to growth than others taxation on
capital and corporations hampers
growth most heavily, mainly because
these taxes lead to fewer innovations.
And are levied on
a particularly mobile tax base.
In a perfect world, taxes are neutral
to the investment decisions of
economic actors, and
they also respect European Union law.
What are these EU law rules?
Well the main issue we need to
think about now, is what is and
what is not harmonized in
the field of taxation?
Bound up to with this,
we also need to consider why.
Certain types of taxes are harmonized,
and other not.
And on what the legal basis the decision
whether to harmonize has been made.
We usually talk about
several sources of EU law.
EU law consists of the founding treaties,
that is the treaty on the European Union.
And the treaty on the functioning
of the European Union.
And the legal provisions based
on the few legislative powers in
this field delegated to the European Union
by the founding treaties.
The provisions of EU law that may have
an effect on taxes are referred to
collectively as EU tax law.
After the entry into force
of the Lisbon Treaty
the European convention on human
rights also became a part of EU law.
And of course,
the court of justice of European Union,
the CDEU has had many opportunities
to interpret these sources of EU law.
Any response to preliminary ruling
requests referred by domestic judges and
in enforcement procedures initiated by
the commission against member states.
As you might imagine, some taxes are more
harmonized than others, depending on their
impact on the integration process, and
my goal is to explain to you now, and why.
And how this has come about.
So let's start with what's been achieved
in the EU in the area of tax law,
and especially with
the sources of primary law.
To start with,
it is often said that the main ID for
a European Union is actually fiscal.
The European Unions mission statement,
article 3.3 of the TU provides for
the establishment of a common market and
the implementation of common policies.
This requires conditions of competition
elimination of disparities as well
as the abolition of to cross border
activities within the common market.
However, the proper functioning of
the internal market may be hampered for
instance by differential tax treatments
of domestic and imported goods.
Tax burdens on cross border
transactions and the administrative
difficulties in dealing with several
different systems all over the EU.
These obstacles may influence
an economic operator's behavior.
And therefore, create a hindrance to
the free movement in the internal market.
Custom union is therefore an essential
element in the functioning of
a single market.
The single market can only
function properly when
there is a common application of
common rules and it external borders.
This implies that the 28 customs and
administrations of the European Union
must act as though as they were one.
Article 28 of the Treaty of
the Functioning on European Union
provides for this.
One it therefore states that the union
shall comprise a customs union.
Obviously a custom union also implies
a common customs tariff applying
outside the border of the union which is
provided for in Article 31 of the TFEU.
The common customs tariff came into
force on the first of July 1968.
So, except for these custom unions, what
has the European Union achieved so far?
Curiously, or perhaps not, not much is
said about taxes in the primary EU law.
But there are lots of rules
that apply indirectly to taxes.
Either granting a mandate to the EU
institutions to harmonize taxes,
that's what we call positive integration,
or to disallow
taxes which amount to obstacles to cross
border transactions, which is referred as.
Negative integration.
The only article in the TFEU that
actually deals specifically with
positive integration and
taxes, article 113.
Which states that the European Union has
the power to harmonize turnover taxes,
excise duties and
other forms of indirect taxation.
To the extent such harmonization is
necessary to ensure the establishment and
the functioning of the internal market and
avoid distortion of competition.
There are other rules dealing with
the fundamental freedoms and they are.
Article 28, 30, 34 and
110 of the TFEU for indirect taxes.
And article 39 to 64 of the TFEU for
direct taxes.
But none of these provisions mentally,
directly mentions the word tax.
They're also supporting that references to
taxation and TEFU's,such as Article 65.1,
on the free movement of the Capital,
or Article 179.2 to
190 on research and
development and on space.
And Articles 191 (2) to 194 (3),
on environment and
energy, which reserve competence to
member states in the area of taxation.
So in a nutshell we can say that
harmonizing taxes is possible,
since the union's
institutions are granted.
The necessary powers to
harmonize indirect taxes in so
far as necessary for the establishment and
the functioning of the European Union.
But the same is not true for direct taxes.
Indeed, as far as taxes,
which are not indirect or
are concerned, Article 115 of
the TFEU provides for the council.
Acting unanimously in accordance with
a special legislative procedure,
and after consulting the European
Parliament and the Economic and
Social Committee to issue directives for
the approximation of such laws,
regulations, or administrative
provisions of the member states.
As directly effect the establishment of
the functioning of the internal market.
Only a few of these directives
have been so far enacted.
These have been in the field
of mutual assistance and
cooperation in tax matters or
even in the field of savings taxation or
corporate income taxation for
groups of companies.
Thank you for your attention.
